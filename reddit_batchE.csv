reddit_post,minnesotatwins,Sp_Gamer_Live,"The 2025 Minnesota Twins: The Season of ______? With a loss to the Phillies that ends the most important season in Twins history since the 2002 season which saved baseball in Minnesota. Going in, hopes were tempered but still optimistic that this team which still had much of its 2023 core could take advantage of a weaker division and make a run, fast forward 162 games and much of that core is gone and even then it feels like only three players have a locker reserved for 2026, and somehow one of them is Kody Clemens. Which leads me to what I try to do at the end of every Twins season: ‚ÄúWhat moment will I remember?‚Äù Since 2019 (when I became a fan) that answer has been 2019: ‚Äú8th inning ambush‚Äù Sano Grand Slam 2020: Max Kepler hits a homer to open the covid season 2021: ‚ÄúThe Season of Stupid‚Äù Matt Shoemaker throws 2.0 innings of shutout ball to close out a 12 inning walkoff win where Buxton sustains a boxer‚Äôs fracture on his first game back from injury 2022: ‚ÄúThe Forgotten Season‚Äù Byron Buxton walks off Jorge Lopez 2023: ‚ÄúThe season the streak died‚Äù Under a chorus of Gausman chants Royce Lewis hits a home run to give the Twins a lead in a playoff game 2024: ‚ÄúThe choke‚Äù Twins are eliminated the same day KAT is traded and a fan is banned for a sign reading ‚ÄúSell the Team‚Äù 2025:‚Ä¶. Well‚Ä¶for most people its obvious. It‚Äôs a season of anger. I don‚Äôt need to give you the story again, everyone knows it: 10 players gone at the deadline including our biggest contract for nothing, local guy, and our elite closer and then a few weeks later a sale of the team was cancelled. People are still rightfully angry about that. Hell, I was on up north during the deadline and the last notification I got before cell service dropped was that Correa was dealt. I remember getting back to the hotel, reading the letter from 2023 and just crying. But for me thats not what I‚Äôll remember the most: Its July 12th, I wake up early off of little sleep and my mom and I hustle down to the stadium so we can get the giveaway bobblehead of her favorite all time Twin. We get the bobblehead and I do not feel well (probably due to the whole not sleeping for more than 5 hours and eating garbage combo) and my mom says ‚Äúyou know we can just go home now?‚Äù but for some reason I feel like I need to stay, the last time I left a game feeling ill it was Gallo‚Äôs massive homer and I ended up fine so I toughed this one out. and thank God I did, or I would have missed seeing Byron Buxton hit for the cycle. I remember telling my mom after the Triple ‚Äúits not likely but he‚Äôs got the hard part down and he‚Äôs got power, so a Cycle is in play here‚Äù I never thought it would happen. I remember seeing the homer go into the batters eye and just hugging my mom as we freaked out having seen history made by our favorite player. I cried during his curtain call, it is the greatest regular season game I have ever been to For me 2025 is ‚ÄúThe season of Buxton‚Äù because he deserved it. Through all of the BS injuries, the cruel jokes, the trade rumors, and just plain bad luck, he finally had the season everyone knew was possible. He also had a golden opportunity to jump ship, contending teams wanted him badly, including his hometown Braves, but no ‚ÄúI am a Twin for life‚Äù. Post-Mauer this team has been looking for a face to replace him, but for Buck was always overlooked. That stopped this year, This is his team. Buxton has cemented himself as an all time great in this organization and honest to god I think 25 will be up in left field one day. So yeah, this year was miserable at times, but as Dick Bremer said ‚ÄúLets watch Buxton‚Äù",https://reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/1nt1d32/the_2025_minnesota_twins_the_season_of/,2025-09-28T22:17:14+00:00,Phillies,3613
reddit_comment,minnesotatwins,DoubleGolfer,"As much as I am thrilled by Buxton's season, and excited to see what Keaschall and Jenkins can bring us in the future, I'll remember this season as the year where the Pohlads finally pushed me over the edge. I've always thought they were cheap and ineffective, but didn't pay them much mind otherwise. Even the ""right-sizing"" comments right after the 2023 season, though off-putting, didn't completely alienate me. The absolute fire sale ‚Äì the Varland trade in particular ‚Äì really bothered me, and to follow that up by pulling the rug out from under us and taking the Twins off the market... well that was what broke me. I'll still be excited for spring training and opening day, I always will be. It's part of my DNA. But man, it's hard for me to want to share my passion for this team with anybody I know at this point.",https://reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/1nt1d32/the_2025_minnesota_twins_the_season_of/ngqbnee/,2025-09-28T22:31:25+00:00,Phillies,821

reddit_comment,minnesotatwins,tek610,"Lost fans (the Pohlads basically gave us the middle finger. Again.) I'm not a MN native, but I lived there for 10 years and became a baseball fan and by proxy, a Twins fan in that time. Even saw about 30 home games during the Bomba Squad season and it was a good time. (Even saw two games of the first round Yankees sweep that followed.) I moved to Wisconsin 4 years ago and stayed loyal to them. That is, until the back to back fire sale/Pohlads keeping the team announcements. I was out. Still love the game, but I needed a new team to get behind. I didn't have any idea how the Brewers were doing when I adopted them as a Wisconsinite. Pleasant surprise to see what a strong franchise (compared to the Twins at least) they are. Reaching the playoffs consistently, crazy sold out park atmosphere, meaningful games late in the season. All stuff i'm not used to. It's like, so THIS is what it's like to cheer for a team that ACTUALLY CARES TO WIN. Not a Twins hater, but y'all can keep em.

reddit_post,minnesotatwins,disasterpop00,"The time I met Rocco Baldelli Back in late September 2023 - about a week after our season ended, and I had even gone to a playoff game at Target Field - I was at a neighborhood park with my 9 year old son in Minneapolis. My son is a huge baseball fan and went to that playoff game with me. We brought a ball and his bat to the park and he was wearing a Saints jersey. As we're walking through the park, I see a guy who looks really familiar to me. I get a little closer and realize it's Rocco. He's just chilling with his wife and daughter and drinking a coffee. I sort of make eye contact with him and give him the look that says, ""Hey! I know you!"" He smiles, waves, and walks over to me. My son and I are thrilled to meet him and we talk to him about how much fun we had that season and how even though we were sad about it ending in the playoffs, how cool it was to experience that energy at Target Field. He was very thankful and then offered to give my son some batting tips down at at the baseball field. He chatted with us for about 10 or 15 minutes and taught my son how the guys swing a bat in the big league. A total class act.

reddit_post,kansascityroyals,TechnicalLeave6989,"How the 2015 Kansas City Royals Won By Playing Their Own Brand of Baseball Kansas City Royals did not copy the trend. It wrote its own plan and trusted it when the games got loud. I remember the hum in that park before first pitch. Kids on their seats. Old timers telling stories. The sport had tilted toward walks, strikeouts, and home runs. The Royals leaned into motion. Put the ball in play. Take the extra base. Catch every tough hop. Then hand the night to a bullpen that did not blink. It sounds simple when you read it, but to live it required nerve. The club carried lessons from the wild ride in 2014 and added calm strength in 2015. They turned routine singles into events. They made nine innings feel like a test of will, not just a spreadsheet fight.

Listen, he's got connections in Lancaster Ohio, and he's been on record with saying ohio is the best state ever. His all time best in the home run derby was in 2019, in Cleveland Ohio.

We haven't made a splash signing/extension since tanner at the beginning of the year. We have the money to work with, considering we won't have the Lane Thomas or Mike Zunino contracts in the books.

reddit_post,clevelandguardians,BuckeyeReason,"Guardians wild-card playoff series homefield advantage, or not? >Remember how the wild-card round was supposed to penalize the lower seeded team by having it play entirely on the road in a best-of-three series? **Home teams are 10‚Äì16 in the wild-card round.** \[BF added.\] >Philosophically? Yes, teams would much rather play at home. There is the advantage of batting last, for instance.... >Why are road teams faring well in the postseason these days? It could be that the talent gap has shrunk. Four of the last 10 pennant winners have been wild-card teams. The average win total for those last 10 World Series teams is 94.2‚Äîhardly juggernaut status. The American League this year, for instance, presents little separation in quality between the one-seed and the six-seed. >It may also be because ballpark conditions are much more uniform than in previous eras. Twenty-five of the 30 ballparks, for instance, use the same infield clay from Slippery Rock, Pa. Mounds are checked regularly to have uniform height and slope. Lighting is superb everywhere. Visiting teams have indoor batting cages to use during the game. (For instance, pinch hitters had to make do in a dank, narrow hallway at Wrigley Field before its renovation.) Dimensions vary, but very little about the playing conditions do. [https://www.si.com/mlb/mlb-playoffs-home-field-advantage-decrease-stats](https://www.si.com/mlb/mlb-playoffs-home-field-advantage-decrease-stats) Progressive Field apparently doesn't provide any physical advantage to the Guardians. However, the winner of the Guardians/Tigers series will face the Mariners with a decisive homefield advantage at T-Mobile Park, according to the above article. >Play the Mariners in their ballpark, with its expansive outfield and lack of carry on batted balls, and you‚Äôre likely to find yourself on the wrong side of a low-scoring game. >[The Mariners](https://www.si.com/mlb/cal-raleigh-seattle-mariners-glute-force-digital-cover) are 20‚Äì3 at home since July 31, including four walkoff wins, and 8‚Äì2 in one-run games. Though Seattle ranks 13th in MLB in ERA, the strength of this team is its pitching staff. Only the Nationals throw more fastballs and only the Rays and Marlins have a higher average fastball velocity, which makes the Mariners the most power-packed staff in playoff position. In the decisive end-of-season games on Sunday, neither the Guardians nor Tigers prioritized winning to gain homefield advantage. The Guardians didn't maximize the team's pitching talents in an attempt to secure home field advantage. Would it have been so negatively impactful to have had Gavin Williams and Tanner Bibee pitch 2-3 innings each (perhaps it would have been positive), or to use Hunter Gaddis and Cade Smith as relievers even though trailing in the game (the Guardians have a day off before the Tuesday play-off game)? Perhaps even more amazing, the Tigers rested their top batters in the Sunday game, even when they might have made a decisive difference in the ninth inning. >Consider this when thinking about the ninth inning Sunday afternoon at Fenway Park, when Jake Rogers stepped to the plate with runners on first and second and one out and the Tigers trailing 4-3 ‚Äì while the Guardians were trailing at home, 5-4 to Texas, in the seventh. >Dillon Dingler was on the bench. So were Riley Greene and Spencer Torkelson. Tigers manager A.J. Hinch could‚Äôve pinch-hit any of them. He didn‚Äôt. [https://www.freep.com/story/sports/columnists/shawn-windsor/2025/09/29/detroit-tigers-aj-hinch-boston-red-sox-season-finale/86410935007/](https://www.freep.com/story/sports/columnists/shawn-windsor/2025/09/29/detroit-tigers-aj-hinch-boston-red-sox-season-finale/86410935007/) The author agreed that Hinch made the right decision resting key hitters and lessening the odds of securing homefield advantage. {BF added} >""That‚Äôs more important than homefield advantage. Does it stink for fans? Who figured for months they would get the chance to watch the Tigers at Comerica Park to start the playoffs? >Sure, it does...."" >The chips fell ... Cleveland‚Äôs way. Not only did the Tigers lose, but [the Guardians won in extra innings](https://www.freep.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2025/09/28/guardians-tigers-playoffs-guards-ball-al-central/86411305007/) with another comeback. It‚Äôs just as well. **If the Tigers get to the ALDS now, they‚Äôll have taken out their nemesis.** >**To do it in Cleveland would no doubt be even sweeter.** And who knows? Maybe it‚Äôs better if this team goes right back to the Guardians‚Äô house. The Tigers swept them there in early July. In fact, the wild-card round lately hasn‚Äôt offered much of a homefield advantage, despite the lack of home games for the lower-seeded teams. ""Sweeter"" to defeat the Guardians in Cleveland than before Detroit fans? I'm positive Detroit fans don't agree with that statement. Do MLB managers actually believe it's easier to win playoff games on the road, perhaps with no family distractions and commutes? If so, why not book local hotel rooms the night before a playoff game? After all, apparently the home team gets to pocket 50 percent of the gate revenues from wild-card games. [https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/postseason-share](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/postseason-share) Personally, I think playing before home fans would be a big plus. Guardians fans attending the wild-card games hopefully will cheer not only for Guardians' excellence, including perhaps for every inning that the Tigers are held scoreless, but especially for Tigers failures, such as leaving batters stranded in scoring positions or making errors. Home games, especially during week days which are school days, also makes it easier to play before family and friends, perhaps further incentivizing home team players. I also would think that teams would make it a priority to reward fans with home play-off games. Especially not using a team's best batters to pinch hit in the 9th inning with runners on base seems ridiculous IMO. Can't even believe the seated batters were happy to not get the chance to secure home field advantage.",https://reddit.com/r/ClevelandGuardians/comments/1nugpan/guardians_wildcard_playoff_series_homefield/,2025-09-30T15:44:33+00:00,Red Sox,6119

We hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Tigers with an **8-5** season series record. Both teams have 3 games to go, with DET **1 GB** of BOS in the WC, and HOU at **2 GB** of AL WC and potentially a spoiler, but with a hill to climb: |Date|CLE|DET|HOU| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**9/26**|vs. TEX, 7:10e; Leiter v Cecconi|@ BOS, 7:10e; Mize v Harrison|vs LAA, 10:38e; Alexander v Hendricks| |**9/27**|vs. TEX, 7:15e; Kelly v Allen|@ BOS, 4:10e; TBD v Early|vs LAA, 10:38e; TBD v Dana| |**9/28**|vs. TEX, 3:10e; Corbin v Cantillo|@ BOS, 3:05e; Skubal v TBD|vs LAA, 3:07e; TBD v TBD| # AL Central outcome This is relatively simple. If Detroit wins **more games than us** in the final 3, **they will win** the AL Central. If we win **as many or more** games than Detroit, **we win the division** (head-to-head tiebreaker). *In other words, we cheer for Boston right now.* # AL Wild Card race This breaks two ways depending on who wins the AL Central. HOU loses tiebreakers to **everyone**, so they must get more wins than DET or CLE. **If CLE wins** * If DET goes **0-3** vs. BOS, HOU needs **2 or more wins** vs. LAA get WC3. * If DET goes **1-2** vs. BOS, HOU needs **3 wins (a sweep)** vs. LAA to get WC3. * If DET goes **2-1 or 3-0** vs. BOS, they **clinch** the WC3 and HOU is eliminated. **If DET wins** * If CLE goes **0-3** vs. TEX, HOU needs **2 or more wins** vs. LAA get WC3. * If CLE goes **1-2** vs. TEX, HOU needs **3 wins (a sweep)** vs. LAA to get WC3. * If CLE goes **2-1** **~~or 3-0\*~~** vs. TEX, we **clinch** the WC3 and HOU is eliminated. \*thank you u/allaboutthosevibes for catching that # Conclusion / TL;DR If either we or Detroit win 2+ games (88+ wins), we're in; if we or DET win 1 game, Houston needs a sweep; if either we or DET get swept, HOU needs 2 wins to eliminate the losing AL Central team. **The only way** we miss the playoffs is **getting swept by TEX and a HOU 2+ win series**, or **1 win vs. TEX and a HOU sweep of LAA**.

reddit_post,clevelandguardians,DZepperoni,"Such an up and down season, but for the positives of this season of Cleveland baseball‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶we had 165 games. That‚Äôs three more meaningful games than anyone thought this team would manage back in July. A ten game losing streak to enter the month, rookies not producing, a rotation in pieces, and a betting scandal that shocked the baseball world and shook Cleveland baseball to its core. And yet? No one could have predicted a 10 game win streak in September. No one could have predicted a 6 man rotation having the best September league-wide ERA in all of baseball. No one could have predicted having both the rookie and reliever of the month in the AL. But Cleveland never said die, and man, what a show they gave us. A greater comeback than the 1914 Miracle Braves? 15.5 GAMES? It may not be the final outcome we all dream of, but we won the AL Central in historic fashion, and let the baseball world know to NEVER count out the Guardians. What about the players themselves? The familiar faces showed who deserved places. Jos√© Ramirezüêê continues to reinforce his statue, Steven Kwanüëë is cool, Bo Naylorüèπ showed more potential, and some nice production from Daniel Schneeman‚õÑÔ∏è, Brayan Rocchioü™®, and Gabriel AriasüåÆ. Austin Hedgesü¶î managed to raise his Vibes+ stat even higher. Tanner BibeeüÖ±Ô∏è really started to earn that contract to end the year, Gavin Williamsüöõ is gonna be good for a long time, K‚Äôd Smithüê¥ yet again leads the league in bullpen WAR, and meaningful innings and outs from Logan Allen2Ô∏è‚É£, Hunter Gaddis‚ò†Ô∏è, Ben Livelyüá∞üá∑, Tim Herrinüêü, and Erik Sabrowskiüòé. What about the new faces? The pitching factory showed it stays legit with Parker Messicküçì and Joey Cantilloüçç both emerging as future big league dudes. Slade Cecconiüó°Ô∏è and Kolby AllardüßÄ came in and absolutely dealt all year. Nic Enright‚û°Ô∏è had one of the best stories in baseball, and was damn nice to watch. CJ Kayfusü¶û and Petey Halpinüê§ had a great time in the OF, George Valeraü©º finally made his debut (and what a time he had), and Chase DeLauterüöö got to be the sixth player EVER to make his debut in the postseason. The future stays bright. The Guardiac-kids have made the postseason 3 of 4 years of their existence now, and the kids show no sign of slowing down, with Travis Bazzana, Angel Genao, Cooper Ingle, Ralphy Velazquez, Juan Brito, and so many more on the way. A small payroll, a small stadium, and yet enough hope, motivation, and vibes to push through everything in their path. Steven Vogt will continue to lead this team, with a perennial MVP candidate for the bats, and SO much potential in the rotation. Every postseason game was so much experience for every single player on this young roster, and it‚Äôs unquantifiable how much of a family this team is. The Cleveland Guardians will be back. They‚Äôll be better. And no matter how much the world ignores em, they‚Äôll always be here and waiting to small ball the shit out of them. I can‚Äôt wait for the first pitch of Spring Training 2026.

You can tell these guys all love each other and are really united. I think a big part of it too is so many of these guys are homegrown players. And I also think Vogt's locker room presence is a major boost to the team; every postgame speech or celebration or interview he gives, you can tell he adores the team and everyone there. And teams believing in and liking their coaches goes such a long way towards performing well They went into two separate major tailspins, one of them being really late into the season, and still rallied back to make the postseason.

reddit_post,clevelandguardians,Drastik651,"[SlangsOnSports] Guardians make up 15.5 game deficit, best since 1914 Boston Braves The Full Circle moment.... In 1914 The Miracle Braves made up a 15 game deficit and went on to win the WS. In last place on July 4th of that year, they were also 15 games behind the NL leading New York Giants. They would end the season 10.5 Games ahead of the Giants and snag the NL Pennant. They also went on to sweep the Philadelphia Athletics in a 4 game series. They were then dubbed ""The Miracle Braves"" The Cleveland team, or more affectionately known as the ""Naps"" , were a last place team in the AL. In 1914 they held a 51-102 record. Nap would hit for .258/.313/.305 slash during the putrid season. At the conclusion, the player/manager moved on from Cleveland. His contract was purchased on Jan 5th 1915 by the Philadelphia Athletics. Faced with their star 2B and Managers departure, the team ownership and writers were looking for a new name. When the team was renamed in 1915, there was a clear effort to capitalize on the popularity of the ""Miracle Braves"" and the success of a team with a ""Native American"" name. While the team and some newspapers later tried to retroactively link the name to Louis Sockalexis, a Native American player who played for a previous Cleveland team (Spiders) , historical sources show that this was likely a post-hoc justification rather than the primary reason for the name choice. The initial motivation was more about mimicking the marketing success of the Boston Braves. This is where the full circle moment comes in. The 2025 Cleveland Guardians just made up a bigger deficit than the team that they were named after. Jos√© is our Nap Lajoie.

Pictures 10 and 11 are 3.5 x 3.5. They are glossy and obviously different from all the other photos. I'm positive that the autographs on all of the photos are real. The autographs on the backside of the Fan Appreciation program (picture 2) are printed and not real. Hope you find these interesting. Does anyone know anything about the photos?

reddit_post,clevelandguardians,McadoTheGreat,"Hell of a run. Fuck the Dolans. I'm a dual Guards-Rox fan, and let me say this: the Rockies have *$30 million* more on payroll than the Guards, and, well, they're the Rockies, who narrowly escaped a ""record-breaking"" season. Imagine what the Guardians could be doing if the Dolans actually *spent* money (which they're totally getting, by the way) to build a lineup of more than 7 minor league kids and 2 good hitters, and a pitching staff that wasn't what we had to deal with right now with maybe 2 good starters and 2 good relievers. The Dolans need to stop hiding behind the small-market excuse if they want to be taken seriously as owners. Our roster is doing its best. Vogt does what he can with what he has, even if he has lapses. The problem sits at the tippy top. Don't get me wrong, this team was great at times. But when you win a division with a negative run differential, it's more lucking into an opponent choke than a masterclass of Guardsball. Our hitters couldn't hit. Our pitching staff, which is good, had to pick up the slack, and look where that got us. Mariners in four. Go Guards.

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,Tasty_Narwhal6667,"The Dolans and the Guards front office deserve more credit than they are being given in this thread. The Guards are competitive every year despite the economic realities of baseball which greatly favor large market teams. 1. Unlike the NFL and NBA, there is no salary cap in MLB. Owners can spend as much as they want. 2. TV money is not evenly distributed unlike the NFL. Yes, MLB negotiates broadcast rights for nationally televised games with revenues evenly distributed to all 30 MLB teams. The majority of MLB games, however, are broadcast locally, not nationally. Each team negotiates a local TV deal and keeps all of the money. Big market teams, in cities with large populations, command bigger more lucrative TV deals. See the link below. The Dodgers take in $196M a year from their local TV deal and the Yankees get $143M a year‚Ä¶both teams are also co-owners of the networks their games are shown on which generates additional revenue for them. Compare that to the Guards $55M a year deal on a network they don‚Äôt own. https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2025/1/30/24355196/mlb-teams-local-tv-2025-update 3. Each MLB team keeps the money it earns from home games (tickets, concessions, ect.). Large market teams in highly populated areas get more fans attending their games. Look at the link below. The Top 10 in 2025 attendance are big market teams. The Dodgers, for example, had twice as many people attend their games as the Guardians. Finally, due to higher demand and more people with money, tickets and concessions at large market ballparks are much higher than in small market stadiums which means more profit for these clubs. If you ever think tickets to see the Guards are expensive go on the MLB ticket app and look at prices to see the Dodgers, Yankees, Mets, Cubs, Red Sox. It will put things in perspective. https://www.espn.com/mlb/attendance",https://reddit.com/r/ClevelandGuardians/comments/1nwhns4/hell_of_a_run_fuck_the_dolans/nhgfog9/,2025-10-02T23:45:38+00:00,Rockies,1860

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,Nearby_University581,"Y'all. I was talking with my therapist earlier this week in a regularly scheduled session. We were talking about things I could do to help my depression, and she asked about going to a Guardians game. I mentioned how it would be cool to see them clinch the Division in person. I've seen a lot of awesome things at Progressive Field through the years. I was there for the SpongeBob walk off vs the Rays. I was at Game 1 vs the Cubs in 2016. I was at Game 1 vs Boston in 1995. Lots of cool shit. But never been in the stadium to clinch a Division Title. My sister was there that night in 1995. So immediately after that session - on Tuesday - I picked one game from what was remaining. And I'll be heading down this afternoon. To see our beloved Guardians keep hold of our Division and win the Division Title once again.",https://reddit.com/r/ClevelandGuardians/comments/1nsjkuc/corner_bar_pregame_and_daily_discussion_thread/ngmx9fs/,2025-09-28T12:06:58+00:00,Rangers,818

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,DZepperoni,"Positives from today‚Äôs Cleveland baseball (postseason format): ~~Playoffs magic number- 0~~ #Division magic number- 1 Today brings game 161. Can‚Äôt clinch the division yet, but sure as hell better win. We are UNDERWAY at the corner of Carnegie and Ontario, with Joey Cantilloüçç on the mound, looking to snap a bad streak- and theyre on the board. Well, it‚Äôs only one run, not too bad to overcome. Let‚Äôs do it immediately! Jos√© Ramirezüêê gets rolling immediately thanks to a double, and cleanup hitter JONATHAN RODRIGUEZüé£ GOES DEEP. SOMEHOW. 2-1 GUARDS LEAD. Didn‚Äôt see that coming! Joey returns to the mound and jumps right into it, retiring the second inning 1-2-3. The bats don‚Äôt make any magic in the second, but the defense definitely does, helping a 1-2-3 inning with some nice glove work and keeping g Joey rolling. We go to the bottom half, wheee Austin Hedgesü¶î gets a single! Also caught stealing, but he got a hit! No more runs yet for the good guys. Joey retakes the mound again, and does allow a solo bomb yo tie the game up. Still, apart from that, goes 1-2-3 and stays in the groove. To the bottom half and JRod gets another hit with a single‚Ä¶ huh. Interesting. He doesn‚Äôt come around to score, but Joey also doesn‚Äôt allow anyone to score, going 1-2-3 in the fifth. Gabriel AriasüåÆ gets us rolling immediately in the bottom half with a leadoff off TRIPLE and then doesn‚Äôt score. Fuck. That‚Äôs annoying. Joey returns for two more batters, and finishes his night with a nice pair of strikeouts. Our favorite Hawaiian ends with a final line of 5.1IP, 2H, 2R, 0BB, and 6K on 77(50) pitches. Excellent day at work. Resident pirate Hunter Gaddis‚ò†Ô∏è is the first up tonight, and he does allow a hit but works around it with a strikeout. The bats get nothing done, so Gaddis reappears for the seventh and keeps cooking. He allows a leadoff single, but then goes 1-2-3 with a pair of strikeouts. Still nothing from the bats (PAIN). *Take me out to the balllllgame‚Ä¶* and we go to the bottom of the seventh! Erik Sabrowskiüòé takes the mound for the second day in a row, and does show it a little, allowing a single and a HBP before recording a strikeout. Time for the big gun, with K‚Äôd Smithüê¥ entering in the eighth with one out. A first pitch groundout (so close to a DP) is a good start, and then the Rangers did some nonsense that I definitely saw and can talk about and he‚Äôs out at home! Huzzah! (Someone tell me what happened pls thx) To the bottom of the eighth! Vogt begins deploying the bench weapons, and Bo Naylorüèπ does, in fact, still exist! He works a 2 out walk‚Ä¶ and then goes nowhere. Dang it. At least K‚Äôd has his stuff, going 1-2-3 in the ninth, and bringing up our 2-3-4 hitters in the bottom of the ninth. JRod keeps producing with a walk (hi Petey PR), and Manzo gives us life with a disgusting bloop single. They‚Ä¶ they IBB‚Äôd Gabby? THEY HBP CJ KAYFUSü¶û???

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,DZepperoni,"Positives from today‚Äôs Cleveland baseball (postseason format): #Playoffs magic number- 2 (HOU dependent) #Division magic number- 2 Still control our destiny. We welcome a Seager-less and Semien-less Rangers to Cleveland as we are UNDERWAY at the corner of Carnegie and Ontario, with Slade Cecconiüó°Ô∏è taking the mound for the good guys. We‚Äôre down 0-4 what the fuck I haven‚Äôt even turned the game on yet CMON GUYS. Well, we go to the bottom half, playing from behind tonight. George Valeraü©º continues flourishing in the majors with a single, and KYLE MANZ-YARDOü•î COMES THROUGH with a 2 run bomb to cut the Rangers lead in half. Slade snaps back to it, with a 1-2-3 second inning, and looking like normal. Gabriel AriasüåÆ gets in the fun (finally) with a leadoff opposites field double, and Daniel Schneeman‚õÑÔ∏è gets him to third, but no runs this time. A one out single does nothing against Slade in the third, with a strikeout and two in play to ensure the score stays the same. Valera keeps rolling with a walk in the bottom half, but no more runs yet. Another random single for the Rangers in the fourth, but again it goes nowhere. That brings an early end to the evening for Slade, who ends with a final line of 4IP, 5H, 4R, 1BB, and 3K on 75(45) pitches. Unfortunate a bad first inning derailed Slade so badly, but it was well done for him to bounce back. Our bats do nothing again, so it‚Äôs time for Erik Sabrowskiüòé to lead out the bullpen march‚Ä¶ and sits em down 1-2-3 with a trio of strikeouts, lookin *nice.* Postseason Brayan Rocchioü™® gets on the continued hitting with a 1 out single, and Steven Kwanüëë moves him up with a nice bunt, but no more runs yet. Sabrowski comes back on for one more strikeout, going 4/4 on strikeouts on 20 pitches (15 strikes) for a great day of work. Matt Festaüéâ spawns in next, and retires the next two to end the inning (nice catch Kwan). *where bats.* Festa gets one more out before allowing a single, and Jakob Junisü™≤ takes over with one down in the seventh. He allows a single immediately (really nice bunt), and then another single, and there‚Äôs two runs allowed‚Ä¶ and some more‚Ä¶ man. Zak Kentü™ñ comes on and stops the bleeding, now down 7-2. Bats still do nothing. Kent retires the Texas team 1-2-3 in the eighth. Our bats might make me snap. Kent returns again for the ninth, and allows a pair of singles, but allows no runs. Zak Kent ends with a line of 2.1IP, 2H, 0R, 0BB, and 1K on 25(19) pitches. I better see our three remaining horsemen on the mound the next two days **no matter what**. Hi Phil Maton! Jos√© got a walk, showing our bats do in fact still exist. HOLY SHIT RED SOX WIN AND TIGERS LOSE!!! Gabby slaps one up the middle for an RBI double, but that‚Äôs where the night ends. THE GUARDIANS STILL CONTROL THEIR DESTINY IN THE AL CENTRAL. TWO DAYS TO GO.

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,JohnnyFire,"A really simple look at scenarios based on our end results, factoring in the results of the Tigers, Red Sox, and Astros: * Guardians win 0 games: 10/16 scenarios still yield a playoff spot, 4 win AL Central. * Guardians win 1 game: 12/16 scenarios still yield a playoff spot, 8 win AL Central * Guardians win 2 games: 16/16 scenarios yield a playoff spot, 12 win AL Central * Guardians win 3 games: All scenarios yield both a playoff spot and winning the AL Central. The math is on our side, but not only do we need to win but we still need a lot of help here. The more the Astros win, the tighter our window becomes. **The threshold for the playoffs ultimately must be 2 wins.** You can't bank on the Angels taking more than 1 game. It also gives insanely higher odds that you'll take the Central, as all we'd need to do is pace the Tigers. They could sweep Boston but it's going to be a challenge. By and far the silliest scenario is one where the Guardians get swept, but so do the Tigers, and the Astros win at least 2 games. We'd basically be given the Central by default despite a slide to end the year, and Houston would knock Detroit out in spite of everything. There's also the odd scenario where the Guardians make it to WC2 instead of WC3. Those happen if the Guardians win 2 but the Tigers sweep. Then the Red Sox' and Astros' better record gets the final spot, thus resulting in us going to either the Bronx or Ontario for the wildcard instead. The scenarios where we miss the playoffs all involved us winning 0-1 against Texas, the Tigers getting one win more than us and Houston winning at least 2. We wouldn't catch Boston, and Houston and Detroit would have better records than us. To be clear, very much a possibility still. Point being, win 2. Just win 2 and you don't even need to think about the rest besides what city you're getting dinner in next week.",https://reddit.com/r/ClevelandGuardians/comments/1nqwd8e/corner_bar_pregame_and_daily_discussion_thread/ngba6j2/,2025-09-26T14:34:49+00:00,Rangers,1875

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,OppositeBoard8781,"Fully realize had we swept and not lost last night it would not have guaranteed a good or BAD outcome in the division round. And losing last night doesn't change that. However I think losing last night makes me feel better about it even just a little. Facing the Tigers for the 3rd time outta 5 consecutive series is a bit out there scenario, probably not much precident there. Its hard enough to sweep a 4 game series and difficult to sweep the same team twice in a row when playing them again with such a quick turn around. So returning for a 3rd series as hot as we've been vs as cold as they've been felt irrelevant and they were bound to get a win or 2 hopefully no more. So I am a bit happy that happened in the regular season now than that 1st win still being on the table.",https://reddit.com/r/ClevelandGuardians/comments/1nqwd8e/corner_bar_pregame_and_daily_discussion_thread/ngae8k6/,2025-09-26T11:31:37+00:00,Rangers,780

I'm confident in our ability to take at least 2 out of 3 from Texas, which would cinch up a playoff spot no matter what Houston does.

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,Rarona,"If we had won the series, people would have said ""see, winning the division gave them the momentum they needed to win in the playoffs!!!"" so your argument can go both ways.

(Losing Ortiz and Clase has ripple effects here) 2) We didn't play clean defense. 3) The offense, to nobody's surprise, couldn't make up for the pitching and defense not being near-perfect like it was the last few weeks. TL;DR - mistakes and shortcomings are exacerbated in a short series.

I hope they all get some semblance of regular playing time next year. Hell, I'd say the youngest guys even looked the best at the plate in the WC series. \- Second half Rocchio. He looked really rough before he was optioned, but he came back a different player. He's making better defensive plays than last year and he even seems to be somewhat of a power hitting threat now. \- Bo Naylor. Okay, obviously he still has a lot to work on. But we were promised a guy who could hit bombs, and in the past few weeks he's become the last guy you want to throw strikes to if there's already some traffic on the bases.

Why was Jrod and Noel starting, etc. Really bad all around with no good reasons for why they were in the lineup. I think we can all agree those 2 playing yesterday probably cost us the game. I know this will get me hate, but I feel like it needs to be pointed out. When will Jose ever really show up in the playoffs? He's our superstar player, but his performance every year in the post season always feels lack luster and not clutch. I'm not faulting him at all yesterday for getting caught between 3rd and home. He was running on contact, it's not his fault no one else on this team can't lift a ball to the outfield for a sac fly. There is hardly any support around him which I'm sure affects his performance, but this is a common theme for him come October. He's a .235 hitter with a .678 OPS in the post season for his career. I'm sorry, but that's not good enough from your superstar player when the lights are the brightest. I'm saying all of this as the biggest Jose fan. This is something I think gets glossed over a lot when discussing our Cleveland's lack of post season success. I hope he proves me wrong and they're able to win the next 2 to advance to the ALDS.

reddit_post,clevelandguardians,Rarona,"Stewing The more I try and absorb this loss, the more frustrated I get, and I need to rant. Vogt: Vogt is a huge part of the reason we are even here, and people who are calling for him to be fired are just speaking from anger. But WHAT IS THE POINT of platooning when your platoon options are worse than the regulars?! Does a single soul think that Kayfus or Schneeman has worse ABs today than Noel or Rodriguez? Not to even mention the defense, which cost you the game, and I can't even blame the players for that...you put them in position to fail. That is your one job as a manager, to put guys into position to succeed, and you did not do so. Noel/Rodriguez: I understand striking out against Skubal. The man is a demon. But for the love of God, would it kill you to at least have respectable at-bats? That 8th inning AB from Noel was an abomination. For shame. I hope they both grovel for Gavin Williams' forgiveness. Not to single out these two here...but they were only starting this game to hit and they went 0/6 with 5 lifeless strikeouts, and gave up 2 unearned runs to boot (although this part I blame more on Vogt). The 9th: I will tolerate no Jos√© Ram√≠rez slander here. Sure, he should of went head down for home and hoped for the best, but he's probably out either way. Instead let's talk about how the only reason this man felt the need to run on contact is because not a single member of this offense can be trusted to lay down a sac bunt or hit a sac fly?!?! The pitching: Hats off guys. You fuckin killed it and I'm so sorry this happened. Winning this game would have probably won you the series. Detroit does not come back from losing a game where Randy Johnson 2.0 pitches 7 2/3 and strikes out 14. Instead you face elimination tomorrow....

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,Ok-Aardvark-5807,"Totally with you. I was starting to let it go until I read this. Dumb move on my part. Here are some of my concerns: \-Why play J-Rod and Noel both? They are strikeout machines. J-Rod is a terrible right fielder. This was evidenced throughout the weekend. He is slow and can't get to the ball. If you are going to play them, why not put Noel in right (he's more competent out there), and either DH Rodriquez and play Manzo at first (he seems more competent there than Noel), or bench Rodriguea and put Kyfuss at first (I know I am butchering last name spelling). Both errors on Rodriguez and Noel led to runs. \-Why let those two guys keep taking at bats? It was clear they were completely over-matched by the end of their second at bats. Pull them. Put Kyfuss at first and Schneeman at right. \-Why not leave Schneeman in after putting him as a pr? Or, why put him in? He could have been used in the 9th. (Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda) \-Why not try to bunt Jose home in the ninth. Again, Rodriguez is swinging for the fences. I think Delauter was available to put in there. Hell of a way to have your first MLB at bat, but he's not going to do any worse than Rodriquez. Ultimately stupid fielding leads to errors, stupid bats lead to no hits, and poor managing leads to a loss.

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,jacob6875,I mean the thing is Skubal is an elite pitcher. We are not going to win when he is in top form no matter what lineup we run out. Even ignoring Noel/Rodriguez we only had 2 balls leave the infield all night. You are not going to win a game like that. The 1 run we did get was only because Skubal bobbled the ball or didn't let his SS/2B field it. If he did Martinez should have been thrown out at home. The scoring opportunity in the 9th was only due to a 2 base error by the Tigers. At best we had to get really lucky and play 100% perfectly to win this game 1-0 which isn't realistic no matter who we have on the field. This is why the postseason is a crapshoot. A pitcher has a good outing and you are suddenly facing elimination.,https://reddit.com/r/ClevelandGuardians/comments/1nur1km/stewing/nh41obv/,2025-10-01T01:26:51+00:00,A's,732

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,weaponize09,"I just picked a random article from last off-season on ""5 free agent outfielders Guardians should target"". Here's the guys and how they performed this season: Tyler O'Neill - got 3 years 51 million from Baltimore. Injured a lot this year and had a -0.6 WAR in 205 PA. Jesse Winker - got 2 years 14 million from NYM. Injured a ton, only 81 PA this season. Teoscar Hernandez - got 3 years 69 million from LAD. Solid numbers at a glance but 1.5 WAR in the most protected line-up ever isn't amazing and awful defensively. Anthony Santander - got 4 years 80 million from Toronto.

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,BuckeyeReason,"Still disappointed with the Guardians' IMO waste of the top pick in the 2024 draft. With Nick Kurtz playing first base, the Guardians likely would have more easily won the Central Division, and would have improved odds of winning the AL pennant. >Kurtz seemed well on his way to wrapping this up even before his [four-homer game](https://www.mlb.com/news/nick-kurtz-hits-4-home-runs-against-astros) on July 25, but the mashing that started that night and [has continued since](https://www.mlb.com/news/yes-nick-kurtz-really-is-having-one-of-the-best-debuts-you-ve-ever-seen) \-- .336 average and 1.120 OPS through Sunday -- has made the race a very easy call. Entering Monday, Kurtz led all qualified MLB rookies with 29 homers and a 1.032 OPS.

After the departure of Carlos Santana, the Cavaliers have faltered defensively at first base. Cringed yesterday when Big Christmas was unable to scoop up a bunt, in the process costing the Guardians a run. Noel apparently is considered the Guardians' best defensive first baseman.

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,Britton120,"a bit sad to see (some) reds fans turn on tito for getting bulldozed by the dodgers. As though they didn't have a very strong September and needed it to get into the playoffs anyway. And of course it very much mirrors our own need to ball in september to make it to october. And similarly some fans are quick to flip on Vogt if we don't win the world series, after absolutely no one expected us to even be competing for a wild card spot (let alone win the division) a month or two ago. And most fans feel similarly about their owners as we do. rangers fans, twins fans, tigers fans, reds fans, astros fans, doesn't matter. The ownership is greedy and refuses to spend on obvious positions to make the team a real contender. Could just copy and paste most of the complaints into anyone's game thread in september and it would resonate (outside of the dodgers and yankees of course, but even then the yankees are so entitled that they can't help but complain). Anyway, all this helps me feel better about the guards and the team we have. Whatever happens today, Guardians baseball in October is fun to see and I refuse to take it for granted, or doom about hypotheticals. We have a lot of young talented players that are fun to watch that want to be here and contribute. The team seems to be in a stronger position than it was this time last year.",https://reddit.com/r/ClevelandGuardians/comments/1nw1i3o/corner_bar_happy_hour_al_wild_card_series_game_3/nhd3js4/,2025-10-02T13:43:21+00:00,Guardians,1345

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,Conscious-Weird5810,It's legit something that should be discussed in owner meetings. Division winners should get preference for time slots.

Some of them are highlighted here. ######TROLLING IN THIS OR OTHER SUBREDDITS I know you want to talk shit, but remember that this is our house and we wouldn't want people brigading here and making it unpleasant. Seeing someone else does it does not make it right. If you do this, you will be banned. Likewise, we're all rooting for the same team and that does NOT mean that we should be attacking each other. Be civil with each other, and if you *have to tell this person on the internet that they're wrong*, then do so nicely without calling them names. ######ALL TICKET SALES ARE PROHIBITED DURING THE POSTSEASON These threads will be removed. Tickets can be sold on Seat Geek or /r/ClevelandTickets ######CONTACTING THE MODS If you see something that doesn't belong, report it. The mod team is trying their best, but we're not perfect people.

On 9/23, David Fry *sacrificed* himself for the team trying to '*suicide* squeeze' Angel Martinez home to tie the game. He was hit in the face by a 100 mph fastball, breaking facial bones and his nose. Although it hit him directly in the face, the umpire called it a foul ball. Fry was replaced during this at-bat by George Valera, and on the very first pitch following the injury, reigning and likely repeat Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal threw a wild pitch.

reddit_comment,clevelandguardians,DZepperoni,"Positives from today‚Äôs Cleveland baseball (postseason format): #Playoffs magic number- 2 #Division magic number- 3 No confirmed October baseball yet, so instead we‚Äôll stay focused on our September playoffs here in Cleveland as we are UNDERWAY at the corner of Carnegie and Ontario. The newest pitching factory product Parker Messicküçì makes his first start versus the Tigers of his young career, and gets greeted with a solo bomb. Let‚Äôs go up from here. After one more solo bomb. Nothing from the bats in the first. For the first time in 20 games, the Cleveland SP has allowed more than 2 runs. What a streak from these guys. Messick only allows one more to keep it a 3 run game. We head to the bottom of the second, and we‚Äôre on the board! A Gabriel AriasüåÆ walk leads to a CJ Kayfusü¶û RBI double. Messick finally settles down, and strikes out the side. The bottom half of the inning features a leadoff single from AUSTIN HEDGESü¶î and a 4 pitch walk to Jos√© Ramirezüêê, but they don‚Äôt cross the plate. Messick does allow another solo bomb in the fourth, making it 4-1 Tigers. We finally break into the rest of the bullpen in the bottom half of the inning, with Kayfus getting another double for his collection. Some weird base running in the inning, but still, no more runs for the good guys. Messick finds some more trouble in the fifth, loading the bases with just one out, but navigated successfully out of the situation with a pop fly and a strikeout. The rookie ends his night with a final line of 5IP, 6H, 4R, 1BB, 7K, and 3 HR on 89(61) pitches. Every rookie will have his off days, just some bad timing here. Bats do nothing in the fifth. It‚Äôs been a few days, but it‚Äôs Matt Festaüéâ time! He does allow a bloop single, but then gets a strikeout and watches as Hog secures another CS, before a walk and a dribbler single(?) nearly derail his inning. Another strikeout instead. Alright bats, you got 4 innings, make some magic. Or 3 innings. 3 innings for magic. Tim Herrinüêü takes over, and does allow a pair of 2 run walks, but gets out of it with a groundout. Still nothing for the bats ugh. We go to the eighth. The cheese man himself, Kolby AllardüßÄ, takes the mound and sits en down 1-2-3 with a groundout, pop out, and strikeout. Cmon, bats, do somethin. Hedgey is working some magic, and got his second hit of the day, another single. Who else would give us hope? Oh yeah, JOS√â RAMIREZ RBI DOUBLE AND THE GUARDS HAVE LIFE, 2-4!!! And that‚Äôs it for the inning god fuckin dammit. Allard returns for the ninth, and gets a pop out before Vogt hands the keys to Zak Kentü™ñ. Kent allows a walk but gets a flyout and a lineout to end the inning. Last chance. Arias goes down looking. Angel goes down swinging. Bo goes down swinging. Ballgame. Destiny awaits when Texas comes to town.",https://reddit.com/r/ClevelandGuardians/comments/1nqo4tv/postgame_thread_tigers_guardians_september_25_2025/ng89535/,2025-09-26T01:09:45+00:00,CLE,2781

reddit_post,motorcitykitties,Pale-Outside2301,"Hot Take(?) If the Tigers Clinch a Playoff Berth Tomorrow, I Don't Want to See Any Celebrating \*Long post incoming, I'm sorry. Thoughts after a long walk\* First off, I'm going to try wording this as straightforward and realistic as possible, that way the believers don't call me a ""doomer"" and the doomers don't say ""I'm out of touch with reality."" I get it, I really do. You clinched a playoff spot, which means at some point throughout the season you did something right. And you did--you were the best team in the league for pretty much the entire first half of the season. But you dropped the ball. You blew it. You're not even limping to the playoffs...you're crawling in the middle of the desert, hoping to god that you find a vernal pool that you can drink water out of. Because you're so dehydrated, that if a doctor looked at you today, they'd be surprised that you somehow stayed alive. You lost a 15.5 game lead in July. A 10.5 game lead entering the month. The collapse from the Red Sox in 2011 wasn't this bad. It's not just any ordinary collapse like you saw from the Mets in 2007. This is historic. Therefore, if you clinch a spot tomorrow...don't celebrate. Don't party. Don't act like you guys are even competitive enough to win the World Series. Don't reminisce about how hard the season was and how much you've overcome. Because the truth is...you haven't. Not yet, anyways. Save that for the potential victory in the first playoff series. Now, I want to say this--do I think this team will win the World Series? Or even make the World Series? Doubtful. At this rate I don't even think they win a playoff game if they make it. However, the great thing about sports is that anything can happen. Players can become heroes, people get hot at the right time, and sometimes just a bit of luck or bad calls go your way. Now, I could be wrong with this, but according to my math the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006 finished September with a 12-17 record...they were only 5 games over .500. World Series champs. The Aaron Boone Yankees constantly go through summer swoons and struggle to play small ball, and Boone is a hard head that always says ""it's right in front of us."" World Series run last year. The Washington Nationals in 2019 went from a terrible first half to somehow rolling through the Dodgers and the Astros, at a time where the Astros had 3 strong aces, all of which are probably future hall-of-famers, pitching for them. Look, do they win the World Series? Probably not. We don't have a Pujols, a Judge, or bullpen depth. If Skubal gets a little rocky, we'll be lucky if our bullpen even keeps the game close. I'm not saying they will win, or even that they could win. I'm saying sports have a habit of being weird and anything can happen. Save your celebration until you at least TRY to make a magical run in the postseason. TLDR: Don't celebrate making the playoffs after the horrendous ball you've played the past 2 months. Save the celebration and wait to see if you can actually make a deep playoff push past the Wild Card round.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nrmu2y/hot_take_if_the_tigers_clinch_a_playoff_berth/,2025-09-27T05:13:01+00:00,Yankees,3060

I don't trust a single guy out of it right now. But also they should **absolutely** celebrate if they make it in. It'd be no less of a miracle than last year.

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,Walk-Radiant,I‚Äôve come to terms with this team. Win or lose making playoffs back to back years is still a great feat. The way this team has been managed roster and player wise really does upset me. But I‚Äôve come to terms with it. I‚Äôve enjoyed the progress Torkelson has made and some progress Riley has made as well. Future is bright and as much as I‚Äôd love to win now. I‚Äôve come to terms that it just might not be their year.

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,yes_its_him,So we're down to one winner-take-all game. Let's see if our guys do a better job of getting the bat on the ball today. It will be interesting to see if we run the same lineup again and expect different results from it. Jahmai Jones has a .797 OPS against RHP this year. Wenceel is .688. Just sayin'.

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,DHooligan,"The Tigers have clinched the playoffs, but we still only have an inkling of who they'll play on Tuesday. If Tigers lose, Cleveland clinches the 3 seed, and we're locked into the 6 seed, which means a 3-game series in Cleveland. If Tigers win, and Cleveland loses, Tigers win the division, Cleveland is locked into the 6 seed, and it's a 3-game series in Detroit. This is the only team the Tigers can possibly host in the wildcard round. If the Tigers and Guardians both win, Guardians win the division, Tigers beat the Red Sox on a tiebreaker and move into the 5 seed. This means the Tigers will be playing a 3-game series in either New York or Toronto depending on who takes second between them. They are currently tied for first, but Toronto has the tiebreaker as they won the season series with the Yankees. So, most outcomes point to the Guardians, but could be Yankees or Blue Jays. Mariners are locked into the 2 seed, so it won't be them, and there's no outcome that would match the Tigers up with the Red Sox because the Tigers need the Guardians to lose to win the division.

Stop paying for tickets and stop watching this shit. The owner of the team has no interest or desire to put any effort into the team - he probably couldn‚Äôt name 10 guys on the roster. They offer insulting, non competitive contract extensions to the best pitcher in the game, then respond condescendingly when questioned about it. With a roster that was playing great baseball right now but had clear needs and opportunity for improvement, they went dumpster diving for bargain deals and cast offs from mediocre teams. Frustration is a severe understatement for the people who have supported and followed this team for years, lifetimes. It‚Äôs actually insulting to watch, because it was entirely preventable. It‚Äôs fair to say that the players are ultimately the ones that are underperforming, but the folks who are running this have completely failed to do their part and they will look back on this season as a success because we were better than we were two years ago. And that‚Äôs just wild to me.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nrjh3k/red_sox_have_less_than_nothing_to_play_for_now/ngez5p3/,2025-09-27T02:28:02+00:00,Red Sox,1117

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,Zealousideal-Sir7331,"Benetti is the most polarizing announcer we've had in Detroit in a long time. Many viewers hate him because of his schmaltzy humor and habit of ignoring the game to make what he thinks are clever and funny pop culture references. I can't even listen to Benetti. I just mute the sound. As for Dickerson: many in Michigan like him. But he's miscast as a radio announcer. He frequently fails to call pitches or update the hame situation. He is often in long monologuing on nuances of the game, while entire plays have happened that he barely mentions. For people who listened to Ernie Harwell...Dickerson is dreadful. He should be on TV. Send Benetti to TikTok where he can make unfunny comments and drool food all over himself, the latter of which we are treated to about once a week. I would argue Detroit has the worst announcers in MLB.

He did intend to use the regular season as a tryout camp for DFA's relief pitchers that we picked up on waivers. If it were up to Hinch, we would have had Bregman on third and he would have played there against left and right-handed pitchers. I don't fault Hinch. I think he should have let Carp hit lefties and I remember two years ago all the concern was that Greene hit too many ground balls.

I plan to travel to Detroit for games 3 and 4 of the ALDS. Excited for my first time at Comerica and to take in the atmosphere generally. I'll be staying at the Trumbull and Porter hotel in Corktown. Few things I wanted to ask: 1) Getting from Corktown to Comerica: Google Maps says 30 min walk. Is this safe and/or doable? 2) Bars/Restaurants: I'm always down to explore nightlife, though Monday-Thursday means it will be slow I assume. Any good bars with live music in the vicinity of Corktown/Downtown? Also restaurants as well. 3) Any other general advice for a visitor to your city would be welcomed.

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,DumpCake42,"2. Not sure if anyone will be playing but the Lager House is right there. Used to be cool venue back in the day, think White Stripes-era of Detroit. It's definitely still a bar, so at least stop in for a cheap drink and take a look around. A much higher end bar would be The Sugar House. Two James Distillery is right there too. For food, check out Alpino, Ottava Via, Ima Izakaya menus. Lots of good stuff around there, tourists are always directed to Slows BBQ which is totally ""fine"". The really good stuff is in Mexicantown on the other side of the train station. Definitely don't walk there but if you grab an Uber to head over there, you can't go wrong with Los Galanes.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nwk1ac/mariners_fan_alds_comerica_trip_advice/nhglemz/,2025-10-03T00:19:10+00:00,Mariners,676
reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,NobleSturgeon,"> 1) Getting from Corktown to Comerica: Google Maps says 30 min walk. Is this safe and/or doable? Corktown is a good neighborhood. Plenty going on here. Trumbull and Porter is a little off the main strip on Michigan Avenue but I would call the whole thing safe and walkable as long as you keep aware of your surroundings. I have spent plenty of time in Seattle and it's similar. For going downtown from that distance, e-scooters are also super convenient, we have Spin and Lime. And Uber and Lyft. You could also take a shuttle from one of the bars on Michigan Avenue (Nemo's and McShane's). Or you can just walk. I don't live far from Trumbull and Porter and I would feel safe walking. > 2) Bars/Restaurants: I'm always down to explore nightlife, though Monday-Thursday means it will be slow I assume. Any good bars with live music in the vicinity of Corktown/Downtown? Also restaurants as well. Corktown is very good for bars and restaurants. In terms of award-winners or really highly-regarded restaurants, Mink and Alpino are very close to Trumbull and Porter. Mink is a tiny restaurant that does seafood-focused tasting menus. Make a reservation + it's expensive. Alpino is alpine food--pasta, german food, etc. A little further away you have Ima which is more casual but is very well-regarded for ramen/udon/asian small plates. If you would like to do Detroit-style pizza, Grandma Bob's is good. Takoi is good (and a bit more expensive), Mercury burger bar is good for burgers (if you go, get the Flint Burger - olive burgers are a Michigan thing. Downtown, make sure you get a coney dog at Lafayette or American Coney Island. Corktown has a good bar scene but I'm not sure what things are like on week days. Sugar House is a top tier cocktail bar. When the weather is nice, Motor City Wine has a nice back yard for DJs and such. Last Chance Saloon is great. The Yard has a good outdoor area. Nancy Whiskey is a neat old neighborhood dive. They do bands on weekends but during the week it'll just be a dive. Downtown, Standby is a great cocktail bar. Cafe D'Mongo's is a pretty unique Detroit spot, check that out if it's open. Not sure about anywhere that would have live music on a week day, maybe Tin Roof which is across the street from Comerica Park and is a massive music/party/shots of fireball type bar. > 3) Any other general advice for a visitor to your city would be welcomed. Having lived in Seattle, St. Louis and NYC I know that urban crime is usually overblown, but any areas to avoid I would obviously like to know. I wouldn't really worry too much about anything in Corktown or Downtown. Michigan Ave is a pretty busy street so there's not a ton to worry about there. I would take Michigan to downtown instead of Fort just because it's busier and nicer. The strip of Trumbull that Trumbull and Porter is on is less busy so still be aware there, but it's not like a bad neighborhood or anything. The area around Michigan and Cass can be busy with people hanging out or waiting for a bus but if you have walked around downtown Seattle it's nothing you haven't seen before.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nwk1ac/mariners_fan_alds_comerica_trip_advice/nhgspz7/,2025-10-03T01:01:58+00:00,Mariners,3093

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,Substantial_Ad_2864,"Walk to/from is fine. There's a bunch of stuff on Michigan Avenue. The only part that's less great is going across a freeway but there's nothing tricky or dangerous about it it's just a section between Corktown and downtown that's fairly dull for about 5 minutes and might not be lit quite as well. You *could* walk to the Michigan Avenue People Mover station and ride that to Grand Circus park for free to cut back on the walk, but that won't save you any time at all but the People Mover is a decent enough way to see downtown and since it only runs in one direction, you can complete the loop on the way back. In terms of avoiding dangerous areas you should be fine unless you go way out of your way (which I can't see why you would because once you go too far in the wrong direction it starts to get kind of abandoned looking so there really wouldn't be any incentive to keep going).",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nwk1ac/mariners_fan_alds_comerica_trip_advice/nhgqrq5/,2025-10-03T00:50:50+00:00,Mariners,887

reddit_post,motorcitykitties,el47000,"Aggressive Baserunning In October - Not the same as regular season [The tag for an out at third base in Game 2](https://www.mlb.com/news/overturned-call-in-tigers-guardians-game-2-takes-run-off-board)--which erased a go-ahead run--is a vivid example of how the Tigers's [much-discussed aggressive baserunning strategy](https://www.mlb.com/news/tigers-set-on-aggressive-baserunning-in-2025) in the 2025 regular season has to change for October baseball. Scott Harris has been on record multiple times this year, arguing that in a 162-game season, it's OK to get very aggressive while running the bases. Yes, Harris explains, sometimes you'll get thrown out. But, you put pressure on the defense, and very often you don't get thrown out. On average, over the course of the season, aggressive baserunning should yield more wins than losses. I think this is probably true. So, for the sake of argument, let's agree that aggressive baserunning was part of the winning formula for the Tigers getting to October in 2025. Now that we're in a three-game series--not a 162-game season--the baserunning strategy has to change. The tag out at third base in Game 2 illustrates how HUGE one out on the bases can be. There can't be a blanket ""always put pressure on the opposing team"" strategy in a three-game Wild Card series (and probably not even in a seven-game World Series). Cleveland has shown they have good defense. They've gotten a TON of outfield assists in the 47* games we've played against them over the past two weeks (*not actually 47 games). In the playoffs, the Tigers should decide DURING each game (not before the game), depending on the current circumstances, whether aggressive baserunning is set to 11 out of 10, or whether it should be dialed back to like 7 out of 10.

reddit_post,motorcitykitties,mkk4,"Drew Lane you have to also hold the players and manager accountable too imo. I saw a lot of questionable things occur in the 2nd half of the season that had nothing to do with what Chris Ilitch or Scott Harris did at the trade deadline. My biggest gripe with Scott Harris after his propensity to gamble on questionable old or injured veteran free agent acquisitions this past off-season and during season was imo EXTREMELY poor usage of the minor league option process for our pitchers this season. Sending down pitchers that were doing well in Detroit or not sending up pitchers that were doing well and then leaving them in Detroit for a considerable length of time to relax, adjust and work their way into the flow of the MLB or to continue doing well at the Major League level, gaining more confidence, gaining more poise and gaining more experience to make them comfortable and hopefully successful; instead of sending them to Toledo even with them performing and doing well in Detroit, for not only development purposes, but to get the best results in Detroit; not even including how we weren't even able to use successful pitchers for up to 15 days due to option rules and protocols. Imo Harris was a master of this process last year and did an EXCEPTIONAL job of utilizing the best pitchers possible all season (outside of Maeda); including our minor league pitchers; especially considering we were down to only one starter at one point last season. Harris's ability to maximize and and get the best out of his young or inexperienced pitching talent was imo the biggest reason why we caught fire, turned around our season and made the playoffs. I feel like he has mostly failed at this this season; regardless or irrespective of any pitching regression from last season. BUT man oh man I watched game after game of where I questioned what is the manager doing and why, and why are the players approaching the game a certain way and who is teaching them, preparing them, instructing them, game planning them, scouting them in this manner; so ultimately condoning, permitting, fostering, cultivating and allowing poor approach, poor basic baseball fundamentals, poor simple strategy and imo questionable basic baseball philosophy. So lastly imo Scott Harris must improve, get better, become more traditional and less quirky and contrarian at the big league level and make much better, reliable, projectable, meaningful and impact win now MLB player acquisitions; especially adding less mediocre, lateral, injured, injury prone, old, and previously ineffective players that are seen ahead of time as a big gamble or extremely high risk. Yes Scott Harris has let me down at points and also greatly disappointed me at other times during this season/offseason, but what is just as illuminating for me personally is how the manager, coaching and players have been exposed and figured out by the rest of the league imo.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nsm28j/drew_lane_you_have_to_also_hold_the_players_and/,2025-09-28T11:34:19+00:00,A's,2919

Even if you brought in Saurez to play 3rd he has a .696 OPS with the Mariners and hitting less than .200 wouldn't have done anything. I think Colt has been good at 3rd and probably keeps that role going forward. I will still say I wish they did more to address the rotation and bullpen. I liked the Finnegan pickup but we needed another reliable pen arm and someone who could anchor the rotation past Skubal, Flaherty and Mize. I don't understand why they went with Paddack, Morton those were bad even without hindsight. I would have liked Merrill Kelly or Littel and just let Melton have the 5th spot on a pitch count and move to the bullpen for playoffs.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nsm28j/drew_lane_you_have_to_also_hold_the_players_and/ngns61s/,2025-09-28T15:08:27+00:00,A's,1209
reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,PassageNo9102,"Ok just because they are doing well in Toledo or Erie does not mean they will do well against big league pitching or hitting. So make a choice you have a pitcher who is not on the 40 man, which means you have to lose some one already on the 40 man, who is dominating hitters that are not major league level and struggling against the ones that are boarder line big leaguers and you lose a year of team control by bringing them up. Or you bring up the pitcher who is doing solid against both minor and major league guys who is already on your 40 man. If you pick the second guy congrats you made the choice Harris makes. If you make the first choice you just ruined a top prospects mentality and when you send him right back down it takes quite a bit to get him mentally ready.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nsm28j/drew_lane_you_have_to_also_hold_the_players_and/ngmuwjt/,2025-09-28T11:49:03+00:00,A's,776
reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,blackoutbrad,"I agree with this. We could have gone out mortgaged the farm for a top of the rotation starter that might have come in and won 9 games, or perhaps been as challenging as Morton was, or maybe even gets hurt first time out. They were clearly not expecting the amount of guys falling off a cliff as we had. I didn't expect Harris to rebuild a rotation. Finnegan, a little rough since coming back from his injury, but that wad a great move. Hitters need to hit. We had 19 losses where we scored 1 run or were shutout. 11% of the games. The pitching too, im not talking relievers. Skubal has been lights out until the 1 pitch or 1 inning where he hasnt and then the game turns. The Oakland grand slam, the between the legs toss the other night? Losing Jobe and more importantly Olson turned the rotation in to a #1 along with a mid rotation guy (thankfully Mize had a strong year) and Flaherty who should be your 5th starter if he is back. Too much of a drop off with the patchwork rotation. I hope '26 has consistency with Mize, Olson and Melton... leaving Tarik off for now as I think he could be gone during winter meetings if an organization will part with their top 2 pitching prospects.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nsm28j/drew_lane_you_have_to_also_hold_the_players_and/ngnsuae/,2025-09-28T15:11:50+00:00,A's,1187

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,Bean_Daddy_Burritos,"The tigers are a bottom feeding team to start the 2024 season. They play horrendous baseball for most of the season. They play above their skill level and go on a Cinderella run that ends in them losing the ALDS to division rival. They do essentially nothing in the off season assuming it will just work itself out. Tigers start out the 2025 season right where they left off, playing above their skill level. Trade deadline rolls around and the tigers do what might as well be considered nothing. The tigers come back down to earth and start looking like the team they were for the majority of the 2024 season. Lose the division after an epic collapse to Cleveland and enter the postseason as a wild card team. After the off season most journalists had the tigers around 92-96 wins and winning the division. They assumed the tigers would take a step forward since they have such a young core roster. That kind of happened. 87 win wild card team. Disappointing, yet predictable outcome for this team. The baseball season is a lengthy 162 games. It will tell you exactly what kind of team you have at the end of the year. For whatever reason the tigers front office ignored everything last season told them because they were fixated on what they did in those last 50 games. The brilliant part is, they probably won‚Äôt spend in the offseason assuming they want to pay Skubal. Then they probably won‚Äôt pay Skubal the half a billion he‚Äôs going to get, they won‚Äôt trade him, then he‚Äôll walk at the end of the year and they will have nothing to show for it.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nsm28j/drew_lane_you_have_to_also_hold_the_players_and/ngzdnnn/,2025-09-30T10:18:09+00:00,A's,1549

reddit_post,motorcitykitties,Personal_Pain,"My opinion on the ideal Tigers lineups With a full regular season almost over, and the playoffs likely, this is what I (a random fan on my couch everyday) think the lineups should be in the playoffs. #vs. RHP CF:Meadows 2B:Torres DH:Carpenter 1B:Torkelson LF:Greene RF:Jones C:Dingler 3B:McKinstry SS:Baez #vs. LHP LF:Jones 2B:Torres CF:Perez 1B:Torkelson C:Dingler RF:Carpenter DH:Malloy 3B:McKinstry SS:Baez Notes: Greene has not earned the right to hit lefties. We need to use him more against righties to get him hot. Carpenter, while still not great against lefties, has improved enough to take Riley‚Äôs spot against LHP. Just because Wenceel is a switch hitter doesn‚Äôt mean he should be hitting against righties. Jahmai Jones in limited plate appearances has been good against righties too. I think he‚Äôs earned full time at bats for now. Even though he‚Äôs a lefty McKinstry is better against LHP than Ibanez has been. As much as I don‚Äôt like Baez vs righties, he‚Äôs still better at the plate and in the field than Sweeney. Parker has no business hitting against lefties right now. Malloy gets on base pretty well against lefties. We desperately need someone who will have good at bats, and I think he could be that guy. Rogers moves down to the 8th hitter when Dingler has a day off.

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,Motor_city_kitties,"I went to Fenway with my wife over the summer. I went as a neutral as the Sox were playing the rays. We really enjoyed the museum they have at the field. If you have the time, I would recommend going to the museum and seeing some the really cool historical baseball stuff they have. We saw lots of Ted Williams, Ruth, and Pedro Martinez stuff on display. They also have a World Series ball for each year signed by members of the respective team who won. The 1984 tigers ball was there signed by sparky Anderson. Other than that, the team store is really cool, and they have a collectors space in the back with some really cool gear. I‚Äôd also recommend going early and sitting or looking at the view from the monster: it‚Äôs really cool and unique. A good photo opportunity is in right field where there is a single red seat in the sea of green; that was the longest home run ever hit at Fenway and the seat is where it was landed, hit by one of my favorites, Ted Williams at 502 feet.",https://reddit.com/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1nr1jg7/birthday_game_at_fenway/ngb11jm/,2025-09-26T13:48:11+00:00,A's,982

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,dead_monster,"Top comments on the Mets and Tigers collapse thread on r/baseball: From a Cubs fan: > And the Mets spent the most offseason $ and had the highest or second highest payroll.

If I was gonna be a fan of one of them I would much rather be a fan of the team that ended up actually making the playoffs regardless of how they got there From a Mariners fan: > If neither had made the playoffs, it‚Äôs still the Mets with their payroll and expectations. Tigers fluked into the playoffs last year and needed to add this offseason to have a chance. Mets had their biggest competition collapse (Braves) and still missed. From another Mariners fan: > I get that the Tigers collapse was more sudden and maybe more surprising. But saying their collapse was worse than the Mets is like saying that food poisoning is worse than stomach cancer. From a Mets fan: > Another way to frame it is that the 15.5 game lead was made possible by the other AL Central teams being below 500.

reddit_comment,motorcitykitties,Pogobat,"Bummer we didn‚Äôt add a bat at the trade deadline. The team piled up some hits today, just not when it mattered. Hard not to wonder what another veteran might do for the whole dugout‚Äôs nerves. That said, a little confidence goes a long way and the kids could still find it themselves. I want to stay positive while we have a pulse. But yeah, they were playing out of their shoes in the first half and the front office didn‚Äôt give them any shot in the arm to sustain that momentum. Going deep will take puppy dog magic at this point, even if we put it together tomorrow. All will be forgiven if the plan works and we‚Äôre contenders through the end of the decade, but it‚Äôs annoying the front office wouldn‚Äôt call an audible after such a strong start this year. We are ahead of schedule on the rebuild. The real test is what they do to build around the last year of Skubal‚Äôs contract in 2026.
