reddit_comment,chicubs,AssocProfPlum,"On paper, avoiding either the Dodgers or Phillies to reach the NLCS is about as much as you could ask for. Padres are scary if the Cubs don't rough up their starters because that bullpen is among the best in recent memory for me as a squad, but that's really the only clear strength on that team over the Cubs imo (besides Tatis of course). Great to be playing at Wrigley and not Petco though. Brewers are the Brewers, idk what else to say. Their starting rotation without Woodruff makes it a lot more manageable. Freddy is great but then it's a whole lot of young guys or Q if they choose that route, and their bullpen is good-to-great but not unbeatable to me. I actually think the Cubs are the worst matchup out of any NL team for the Brewers since they \_should\_ outslug them and greatly suppress their run production with their elite defense. No other NL team has that combo (Phils got the slug but bad defense, same with Dodgers). Regardless though, these are all great teams with few holes",https://reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/1nt1npm/mlb_postseason_bracket_officially_set/ngqeyhx/,2025-09-28T22:50:00+00:00,Phillies,997

I know it all worked out for us in the wildcard series, but I can't help but question the early hooks of our starters while trusting our bullpen to throw more pitches than they have all season. Has the game simply changed? Or is Craig Counsell over-managing our pitching staff? Taillon was dealing today, but he was pulled after just 60 pitches. He showed no signs of distress during his outing. Meanwhile, Keller clearly ran out of gas. And Kittredge pitched in all 3 games. Plus we saw Boyd warming up in the bullpen today. I've been watching the Cubs since 2004, and a lot has changed since then. I just find it bizarre that our starters are getting pulled so early and that our already taxed bullpen is being trusted more to get most of our outs. It just feels backwards. I mean they're failed starters, right? It just feels like it's going to catch up with us... like it'll get exposed in a longer series. But maybe he'll give the starters longer leashes.

I'll always remember a guy behind me talking trash at Wrigley because I was wearing a Darvish shirt. I said he'll be fine and he ended up pitching one of his best games of his Cubs tenure. If I remember correctly the offense gave him no run support like always. He is a huge reason the Cubs have been able to tap the Japanese for is to enjoy Seiya and Shota.

The PCA I loved for 3 months in 2025 has become the frustrating PCA from 2024. Shaw's brief splurge around the ASB is a memory. Happ - who had a good September and who I've always thought was unappreciated - has been awful. Yeah, Tucker finally got a hit -- but unless he can come up big tomorrow (and further)? I'm letting him walk and saying mean things about the trade. In early July, I was claiming to a buddy -- This team is gonna score 1000 runs!

reddit_comment,chicubs,TwilightSaphire,"I like David Ross, and I think he was a lot better at strategy than Maddon, who over-relied on a handful of closers and was generally very old-school. But I don‚Äôt think he was very good at getting the best out of players. I like what I see out of Counsell so far. Obviously he had a lot of success with the Brewers, but they‚Äôre still great without him so far. It‚Äôs sometimes really hard to tell the manager‚Äôs effect in the team‚Äôs performance. I bet Rossy gets another shot.

He was then traded to the White Sox in 2017 as part of a trade for Jose Quintana. From the White Sox he was traded to the Padres before the 2024 season. \-This year, in 2025 he is 8-12 with a 4.55 ERA. He's pitched in 168 innings, striking out 215. \-His best game this season was on June 10th, when he struck out 11 batters through 7 scoreless innings against the Dodgers \-His worst game this year was on April 8th vs the Athletics. He allowed 9 earned runs through 4 innings \-Will lean heavily on the four-seamer and slider, which he throws around 41% of the time for both of them. Followed by the curveball at 8% usage, sinker 5% usage, sweeper 3% usage, changeup 1% usage **Strenghts** \-High strikeout/swing and miss profile and pitch mix. His slider is his best pitch with a 42.8% whiff rate. \-Solid fastball velocity at around 97.1mph, also his sinker averages about 96.1mph \-Workhorse profile. He commonly throws 170-plus innings a year. Can commonly go deep into games when needed **Weaknesses** \-Command and control. Can commonly hang pitches when sliders or fastballs are left in the zone. If he cannot command his two main pitches (fastball, sliders), hitters often exploit him \-Left-handed batters tend to have more success against him compared to right-handed batters. The fastball tends to be less effective against lefties, making him utilize his less effective pitches. \-Because he often leans and depends heavily on his best stuff, if one of them is down or mislocated, he is vulnerable to giving up multiple runs an inning. **Gameplan** \-Be selective, early take pitches, and attack the fastball. When Cease falls behind, he leans very heavily on the fastball, which can often catch too much of the plate. Middle-Away is the spot he aims for to get back in the count. \-Be aggressive on the bases. Bunt, steal, and force pressure to disrupt his timing and rhythm. \-Exploit explosive innings. Cease is prone to one big inning when command breaks. These come in bursts walk, double, wild pitch, etc. Capitalize on them",https://reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/1nv8ffo/dylan_cease_scouting_report/,2025-10-01T13:37:16+00:00,Cubs,2266

The Padres will have a short leash with him, and if he gives up 2+ runs and they fall behind, I imagine they'll go to the bullpen early to try and keep the game close.",https://reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/1nv8ffo/dylan_cease_scouting_report/nh6ysbp/,2025-10-01T14:38:52+00:00,Cubs,475

reddit_comment,chicubs,theatreboi_23,"Specifically regarding the Boyd decision, I think the main focus for most people is innings and pitches (""he was only at 4.1 and 58!!""), but he was also about to begin his third time through the lineup. He had given up 4 hits and 5 baserunners through his first 4 innings, and he was about to face their best hitter in a lefty-righty matchup. Tradition says to leave him in because his pitch count is low, but the situation says it's a big risk, especially after giving up a single immediately prior. Also, if the Cubs had scored 5 or 6 and Boyd is working with a larger lead, maybe he stays in to save the bullpen for the next game. But because it's so close and the situation is difficult, Counsell made the move and I thought it was a good one. Personally, I think using Palencia right there is also super cool because it's like a ""personnel changeup."" Boyd is a lefty whose fastball normally sits around 93 mph, and his second-most-used pitch is a 78 mph changeup. Going from him to 99 mph righty Palencia might make his stuff seem even faster. Very creative imo. And finally, I think the most impressive aspect of Counsell's management showed not in the game, but after. How many players- pitchers, especially -did you hear criticizing about their usage? How much complaining did you hear about different roles, shortened innings, etc.? This team, to a man, consistently speaks about being a team and just doing whatever's asked of them. This team has a culture of humility, teamwork, and selflessness, and I think Counsell deserves a lot of credit for creating and maintaining that culture.",https://reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/1nuz869/question_about_counsell/nh89bhl/,2025-10-01T18:23:51+00:00,Cubs,1596

To start, Boyd really just did not have it. His change looked really flat and wasn't getting Whiffs, so he was basically working with the fastball and curveball and would not have survived off just those two. For him to get as far as he did was a testament to his grit and the defense. Counsell put in Palencia in the 5th before Tatis got a 3rd look at Boyd, had the handedness matchup in Palencia's favor for 3/5 batters he would go on to face, with the intent of going up until the 6-8 batters who were 3 straight lefties. He brings in Pomeranz for that, then Kittredge for the 8th to dispatch their righties and Keller for the final 3, knowing he's solid vs both handednesses.

reddit_comment,chicubs,Impossible_Ad_6079,"This may extend beyond the original scope of your question - some of the fanbase seems to lean on the point of, ""Why do we pay him $8M a year when that's nearly double what other managers make?"" And, on first blush - it's fair - it's not like the Cubs have won 2x as many games as their competitors, and his former bench coach, Pat Murphy, has led the Brewers to back to back NL Central titles. However, as a Cubs fan who has resided in Milwaukee during his tenure - I was ecstatic when he was hired. For me, he executes the core things you want in that role - he fosters a positive environment (physical and mental) which fosters a winning culture, he is able to manage 30+ people to work towards a shared goal, and finally he consistently makes data-informed decisions that position the team to win. This bears out in his career winning percentage of .533 over 1,656 regular season games in 11 seasons which comes out to averaging 86.3 wins a year. (He's even better as the Cubs skipper: .540 over 2 seasons.). Sure, he's 8-12 in the postseason (which includes his 6th playoffs now with the Cubs), which has inspired the snark - ""They may call it Craig-tember, but it's never been Craig-tober."" However, it's way too early to write him off as a choker. Beloved Joe Maddon, who also traversed the small market to glamour franchise path, was a career 32-35 in the postseason over 8 trips - and that also included a World Series loss in '08. (The 2016 run helped juice that overall record netting 11 wins v 6 losses). Sure, careers are judged on ""ringz"", but I align with the mental model that ""the playoffs are a crapshoot"" - so the best thing you can hope for the lineup to be versatile to best adapt to any potential scenario. And this 2025 squad embodies that - they're 6th in SLG, 11th in OBA, 3rd in Stolen Bases While the starting and relief pitchers may not be toolsy elite - they're mature in stature (rookies Horton and Palencia are the exceptions, as greybeards dominate the rotation and pen) and in executing their gameplans (least BBs in MLB, and best in WHIP). Finally, they can defend - only one thousandth decimal point behind the league leading Rangers in efficiency. Here's another plus about the Counsell hire - from Day 1 he's been a great fit to the Hoyer administration, while still able to impart his own influence on the team - be it from bringing in speed specialists Quinton Berry/Jose Javier to be his on-field coaches, to changing the user-interface of the data dashboards, to engaging team leaders on how to arrange the locker room and dugout to facilitate peer connection. He's not a fiery guy whose gonna show up an umpire. He seems polite, yet aloof and laconic in his (endless) amount of press conferences he's obligated to deliver. However, his players appreciate his steadiness and preparedness - and have to respect a guy who has won 2 championships as a player, as well as earned NLCS MVP during one of those runs. No manager is perfect. However, given this franchise, and it's fervent fanbase, and all the dimensions it takes to execute this role - I'm really good with Couns.",https://reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/1nuz869/question_about_counsell/nh7iiw2/,2025-10-01T16:14:52+00:00,Cubs,3113

reddit_comment,chicubs,afreidz,I like the idea of an opener in game 2 of a 3 game WC series. Gives you a chance to at least see 1 inning before you burn a top rotation starter. Say Kit deals and the cubs put up a 5-spot in B1. Might think about saving Sho and turn it into a pen game. Especially how the pen played today. You can pick and choose when/if to play Sho. Which is a sharp move in a best of 3 IMO.,https://reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/1nurm4f/bastian_cubs_announce_that_reliever_andrew/nh3jkrv/,2025-09-30T23:40:44+00:00,Cubs,377

The Cubs provided entertaining and meaningful baseball all spring and summer and managed not to completely collapse down the stretch.

Our core of position players are all excellent defenders and have at least serviceable bats, with Busch, PCA, Amaya, Shaw etc still room to break out. Jed and Counsell have proven they can piece together a solid bullpen. The Padres are tough and it could go either way, but I won't be too sour if they go out in the first round.

reddit_comment,chicubs,AlwaysHungry94,"Just imagine, if they didn't go through that rough patch they would most likely be just under or just over 100 wins. Bet nobody expected that kind of performance coming into this season. 92 wins is still impressive. Regardless of what happens in the Post Season, it was a solid year, and definitely something to build upon. Saw what some of the young guys can do, and getting that experience now is for the better. Getting into the post season is just the cherry on top. Sure, not all of the prospects hit the ground running, but Horton had a solid performance and PCA had a crazy good first half.

reddit_comment,chicubs,ShirlLotJack,"Just over a week ago, I posted some milestones I wanted to see by the end of the season. Happy to say that most were accomplished: ""**PCA get to 30/30**. He needs 1 HR; **Busch get 30 HR**. He needs 1 more; *Nico get 30 SB*. He's needs 2 more. Nico batting title. Not likely, but fun to watch that chase; **Dansby 20/20**. He needs 3 SB. Less likely to happen than the others; **Seiya 30 HR**. He needs 3 HR, so that is a longshot, but it would be huge for him (and the team) to get hot in this final 8 games; Most importantly, of course, is that the **team secures the top wild card spot** and remains (and returns to) fully healthy."" Nico getting his 30th SB in today's final game would be fun.

reddit_comment,chicubs,RIP_Hopscotch,"The Padres rotation is honestly not good. Even without Horton, the Cubs have better starting pitching. Pivetta is a solid pitcher, Cease and King are both very mediocre, and Darvish is, sadly, no longer a guy they are going to give the ball to in the playoffs. Taillion has been locked in lately, and while Boyd and Imanaga have had their struggles of late, the Padres offense has a harder time handling lefties than they do righties. The Padres offense isn't the most frightening in the playoffs. They aren't really big in the power department, they don't really run a lot either. If you're looking at runs scored, they're in the bottom half of the league. However, they are really, really good at not striking out. The Cubs starters are just gonna have to throw strikes and let the elite defense behind them get the outs, but the Cubs definitely are a better offensive team (especially if two out of the three of Seiya/PCA/Tucker can be productive). The Padres have the best bullpen in all of baseball though, with four guys who could be closers on basically any other team. If the Cubs are behind and the Padres go to the pen, it's going to be hard to claw our way back into the game. The Cubs need to abuse the Padres weak starting pitching. With that said, Cubs in 2. It's not that I don't think the Padres are good - they are - but that it's just a BO3.",https://reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/1nsgo62/what_are_your_honest_predictions_for_the_wc/ngo0dyw/,2025-09-28T15:48:44+00:00,Padres,1359

reddit_comment,cardinals,Nednarb9,I agree with the sentiment about the Cardinals being bad under Marmol as the reason but I think there is some added complexity. I think it adds a lot of fuel to it when they fired Schildt who was successful and generally well liked for Marmol to be the replacement. Schildt landed at a good spot and has remained successful. It leaves a bad taste in fans mouths. Obviously there is more to the Schildt firing that fans are not privy to. Fans are also crashing out a bit on front office and cardinal way style the organization has run. Mo being the one to hire an internal guy with no experience over potential outside candidates who have had success pisses them off.,https://reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/1nujhnu/genuine_question_from_outsiderwhy_do_cardinals/nh1kj0y/,2025-09-30T17:39:55+00:00,Marlins,666

reddit_comment,cardinals,da_choppa,"I don't dislike Oli, but I'm not a huge Oli stan either. he has his strengths and weaknesses, and he's been given some crappy rosters. I think the main reason his haters don't like him is the team has mostly been bad under him. Pretty simple. But there are other reasons, and the Oli haters don't necessarily all share the same reason. Some are people who like Shildt or at the very least hated how he was fired. These people see Oli as a puppet of the front office, which may or may not be fair. And they hate the front office, at least, they did under Mozeliak. To them, Oli is synonymous with the late-stage Mo era. These are the people who will turn on Chaim Bloom first, because he didn't fire him. Oli made a bad mistake in the 2022 playoffs, his first year managing. He pulled starter Jose Quintana, who was rolling, somewhat early. Eventually, that led to Ryan Helsley attempting a two inning save just a few days after he injured a finger in Pittsburgh. Helsley was fine in his first inning of work, then fell apart in the 9th, and the Cardinals lost the game and the series. In hindsight, injury or no injury, asking Helsley to go 2 innings is always asking for trouble, even when he's at his best. Oli developed ""Helsley rules"" afterwards to maximize his effectiveness, to great success. But people are slow to forgive playoff mistakes, especially first-impression playoff mistakes. And the team hasn't been back to the playoffs since. The Tyler O'Neill situation, followed soon by the Willson Contreras situation. Oli publicly called out O'Neill for lack of hustle early in 2023. Some people liked it, but most didn't. It was really more on the third base coach than the player, but whatever. Then later, as the season was already unraveling, the pitchers threw newly signed catcher Contreras under the bus. Oli stopped Contreras from catching for a bit and played him in the outfield before eventually returning him behind the plate. And the whole season went to shit. That's plenty of ammo for Oli haters to point to about bad leadership, and they aren't necessarily wrong. I do think since then, he's been better, but again, it takes a lot of success to overcome high profile mistakes. There's his age, and the fact that he never made the majors as a player. When he became the manager, he had players that were older than him. There is speculation that in his first year as manager, Yadi, Pujols, and Wainwright were really running the show. And of course, that season was Oli's best... There are some intangible arguments that are less compelling. These are mostly along the lines of ""he's smug"" or ""he got on the bad side of CB Bucknor so now all umpires hate him and by extension the team and they purposefully fuck us."" I dunno, man, I think a lot of managers are probably smug, and nobody likes CB Bucknor, so these arguments really don't hold much water even if they're true. They'd also all be forgotten if we, you know, won. I will say this, every reporter says the players like him. And I think his in-game decisions are generally good. He has done a good job with the bullpen (besides the 2022 playoffs). He's probably gotten this very mediocre team to win a few more games than they should, or would, under another manager. But he also hasn't been able to get complete buy-in from players towards his staff, and there have been some incidents of sloppy fundamentals too. I'm fine keeping him for next year, but I fully expect him to be gone after the lockout once this team is ready to seriously compete again.",https://reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/1nujhnu/genuine_question_from_outsiderwhy_do_cardinals/nh25iln/,2025-09-30T19:20:54+00:00,Marlins,3537

reddit_comment,cardinals,DiscoJer,"It's nothing compared to the anger about Matheny. He was a terrible manager and hire (no experience managing at all). But we've missed the playoffs 3 years in a row now, with Oli at the helm. Meanwhile, the previous manager who we fired did make the playoffs in his last year (90-72) and has taken the Padres to the playoffs the last two years. Obviously, Shildt had better teams, but there's no consistency in the Cardinals. Make the playoffs and lose in them? You're fired!. Miss the playoffs 3 years in a row? Keep managing until whenever. It's especially galling when our owners made a statement when firing Mike Matheny (the manager before Shildt) that .500 was not acceptable for a team like the Cardinals. Indeed, a lot of this is about the double standards that the former POBO Mozeliak had. He was won a WS in 2011 but apparently had a job for life, despite running the Cardinals into the ground. He only left because he wanted to retire. People really hated him and Marmol was his golden boy so some of that spills over. Coupled with the hypocrisy of firing previous managers after winnings seasons yet Marmol still being employed after losing ones. I don't think Marmol is a bad manager, but there is a lot of sloppiness in the team's play that we saw in Matheny's days that Shildt was hired to fix (as quality control coach).",https://reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/1nujhnu/genuine_question_from_outsiderwhy_do_cardinals/nh1w9my/,2025-09-30T18:36:06+00:00,Marlins,1337

Because the Rangers [have parted ways with Bruce Bochy](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46427863/bruce-bochy-texas-rangers-manager): >Among the potential replacements for Bochy in Texas is former [Miami Marlins](https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins) manager Skip Schumaker, who joined the Rangers last November as a senior adviser for baseball operations. >The 45-year-old Schumaker was the 2023 NL Manager of the Year after the Marlins went 84-78 and made the playoffs. They slipped to 62-100 in 2024 with a roster decimated by trades and injuries before the team and Schumaker agreed that he would not return for this season. He was previously a bench coach for St. Louis, where he had played for the Cardinals during their 2011 World Series championship over Texas. >\[President of baseball operations Chris\] Young said Schumaker would be a candidate, but that there had not yet been conversations within the organization about the search process. On the other hand, [per MLBTR](https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/09/bruce-bochy-will-not-return-as-rangers-manager-in-2026.html), Young is talking about serious salary cuts with the Rangers, and maybe, if opportunity comes elsewhere, he doesn't want to be part of that. EDIT: Per commenter, I see [Woo's story](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6676555/2025/09/30/oli-marmol-cardinals-manager-2026/) that Bloom has tagged Marmol. That said? That went up WHILE I was writing this original (after posting about Bochy on r/mlb.) Timing is everything, eh? And, besides, Marmol could still be fired midseason, and if so, then Skip is presumably still out of the running as a mid-year or 2027 replacement. As for post-2026? Buster Posey gave Bob Melvin one courtesy year, even picking up his 2026 option in the middle of this season, then canned him yesterday.",https://reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/1nuhsgd/scratch_schumaker_from_marmol_replacement/,2025-09-30T16:25:54+00:00,Marlins,1967

reddit_comment,cardinals,MasterDave,"I don't think he'd take the St. Louis job because it's really just being held by Marmol until Pujols or Yadi is ready for it the way i figure. Whether that's sometime next season, or 2027 once Marmol's contract is out, I feel like things are set for one of them to make the leap. Pujols has been outspoken about his desire to manage a Major League team and is doing the WBC, Yadi did the last one for Puerto Rico with decent success. I'd personally like to figure out what it'll take to get Yadi in the dugout for the next decade over Pujols, but it all depends on whether or not the Cardinals will make the move before someone else does for either or both of them. I don't suspect that either of them will patiently wait in a minor league job or a winter league for much longer, as there are much worse former players that have been given major league managerial jobs with less managerial experience. I know that the decision today is ""we're sticking with Oli"" but all that could change with a bad start to the season if not a bad spring or anything.",https://reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/1nuhsgd/scratch_schumaker_from_marmol_replacement/nh1a7at/,2025-09-30T16:51:22+00:00,Marlins,1051

In such event, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the billing period you choose, unless cancelled in accordance with the instructions for cancellation below. Payment will be charged to your chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase and at the start of every new billing period, unless cancelled. You can turn off this auto-renewal by canceling your subscription as described below.* ***You will be notified at least thirty (30) days prior to renewal of an annual subscription or season pass subscription, as applicable, at the email you maintain as part of your account information. The renewal notice will include the amount and date of the upcoming renewal payment.*** It appears that they skipped this notification email entirely.

reddit_comment,cardinals,willreily,"TBH, don‚Äôt hold your breath on a Star FA signing. It‚Äôs definitely not happening within the next couple years, and beyond that, I doubt the DeWitts or Bloom want to get into the bidding war to get a Star Free agent. It‚Äôs a different time; not many high level Free Agents are going to choose St Louis for a while, and even if they‚Äôre open to STL , we‚Äôd still need pay top dollar. I think the next Star/superstar is A). Going to be drafted/acquired as a prospect and then hopefully extended or B). Traded for like Holliday, Goldschmidt, Arenado, etc, and signed to an extension. Maybe Wetherholt becomes a perennial All Star caliber player. Maybe we get lucky and sign an International prospect who becomes a superstar. Or a star close to FA becomes available, and Bloom thinks it‚Äôs the right time to strike and hope we can resign him (even though they didn‚Äôt sign think of HOU trading Kyle Tucker, Nationals trading Soto, etc). That‚Äôs why Bloom has been saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to prioritize long term core building‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt skip any steps‚Äù. There is no bonafide Superstar on the horizon for us at the moment. They‚Äôll need to continue trading for prospects, drafting, etc., and hope they hit the jackpot on 1-2 amazing players that can be pillars for what the next core looks like.

reddit_post,Brewers,LegitiamateSalvage,"Reflections on this Season Warning: long. As I watch the Padres/Cubs and other WC teams this week and gear up for what is destined to be an emotional NLDS and potentially playoff run, I wanted to pause and share some thoughts. Being in my 30s now, I'm old enough to remember sitting in the nosebleeds of County Stadium, chucking peanuts at friends and ducking as they sailed back and over the wall to the parking lot below. The speaker in center field echoing off the concrete of the stands, the beer mug and slide standing proudly representing the team. And... the sub-standard play of the Brewers of the 90s. Going to the game then was a family trip, a place to be with friends and family and if the Brewers won that day it was a pleasant surprise. You had Molitor, Vaughn, and Yount's 3,000th hit. Later Jaha, Jenkins, Burnitz, and Cerillo now a bit lost in time. The tailgates impeccable, the vibes casual. In 2001 Miller Park was built, and despite the tragedy of Big Blue, the stadium opened with a bang and a 5-4 victory against the Reds. In some ways it heralded a new era. Some years later the Selig's sold the team to Mark Attanasio and an increasingly competitive and fun to follow team was had in Milwaukee. The Cardinals were the enemy, the Cubs still losers, and Houston still in the division. We had the gold medalist Ben Sheets, the pick off artist Chris Capuano, and the lock down years of our shaggy haired giant Turnbow. Prince Fielder, Ryan Braun, and Bill Hall were raking. In 2008, the Brewers made the playoffs for the first time in my lifetime. CC Sabathia was a big mid-season acquisition - a rare move for the smallest market, and we were rewarded with one of the most incredible runs of pitching I've ever had the privilege of watching. I was there at that first playoff game in Miller Park with friends. I don't remember the game as a young and irresponsible college student, I was blacked out, but I recall the atmosphere being electric. It felt like a turning point for a franchise that was deeply loved but had no serious hope or expectation of being good. For the first time in my life, I could look to each season with hope and discuss the possibilities with friends and family. The team was young, exciting, and gave a reason to believe. Since then there have been highs and lows - more highs than lows. There have been playoff disappointments aplenty, and an utterly infuriating loss to the Cardinals that still stings more than the Mets ever could. A shot at glory against the Dodgers that came up just short. And of course, the heartfelt loss of Uecker most recently this off-season, a man who filled the air of our Wisconsin summers for decades. I was fortunate to attend the memorial game with my dad, a memory I'll cherish despite the most Ueck-possible outcome. This season I walked the streets of Vienna on my way to a work event in disbelief as the Yankees hit an incredible number of home runs against a former Yank to open the season. Dared to hope when Priester and Patrick joined and made an immediate splash. Watched Yelich slam his first walk-off HR, a grand one, on the way to an 8-game streak. The arrival of Miz, Vaughn, and a season that would break all sorts of franchise records including wins and win-streak. This year has been the most incredible season of Brewers baseball I've had the privlege to watch, enjoy, and call myself a fan. The accolades could go on - Peralta, Collins, Durbin, Uribe, Megill, Sal, Brice and on and on - damn near the whole team has participated in making this season a special one. On the eve of this year's NLDS, I wanted to share this. Because no matter how much I want to see the Brewers in and win the final game of the year, this season and this history is nevertheless special. No matter what happens, win or lose, this team and this community has been fun, exciting, and a blessing to be able to partake. The teams of the 90s and 00s are a distant memory now, but they are a reminder that making the playoffs and coming up short, disappointing as it is, stands in contrast to the fact that we even *dare* to hope that we can win it all. I hope they do. I will be sad if they don't. No matter what, I will forever remember this year as a fan of my favorite team of all time, watching the conclusion of it all with my parents, wife, and son. And thankful to have that opportunity. Please share your own stories, go Brewers!",https://reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1nveoep/reflections_on_this_season/,2025-10-01T17:30:54+00:00,Yankees,4414
reddit_comment,Brewers,sus4th,"As a recent Milwaukee transplant, I feel almost bad rooting for the Brewers now when I didn't have the years of anguish to make this season feel earned. I grew up in Northern California as a mostly-casual Giants fan, but in the late 90s I went to quite a few games and saw Barry Bonds' last HR at Candlestick and first HR at Pac Bell Park (now Oracle Park). I started working for a company based in Milwaukee in 2017 and went to 2 or 3 games a season until COVID, then we moved here in late 2022... but we've pretty much been Brewers fans ever since. (When the Giants came to town last year, I realized I was rooting for the Brewers and not the Giants, which shocked me.) We live a LOT closer to Miller Park than we lived to Oracle Park in CA, and that means more games. Even when the Brewers were mired in their dark May days (I was at the Cribbage Board game, the 7-0 loss to the Twins that didn't feel that close), I knew I would still go to a lot of games, even if they played that badly the rest of the season. It's been fantastic to see them turn it around and have the record-breaking season. Plus, they're a lot of fun to watch. I feel spoiled that my first 2 full seasons with the team as a new Milwaukee resident has been two NL Central championships. I hope I appreciate the ride... and I hope it doesn't stop.",https://reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1nveoep/reflections_on_this_season/nhap8n0/,2025-10-02T02:14:43+00:00,Yankees,1321
reddit_comment,Brewers,trashboatfourtwenty,"Nice, I wish I had a full life history with the team and had seen a game at county but I grew up a casual Cubs fan and didn't think much about the Brewers until I moved up here just a month after the ill-fated All Star Game. As a radio person it was easy to listen to Bob all the time and already knew a bit about his lineage as Pat Huges left Bob and Milwaukee to join the Chicago broadcasts in the 90's, and both the general underdog mentality and players that I came to know and love, starting with guys like Podsednik, Jenkins, Overbay, and Sheets, watching Fielder and Weeks and Hart join and see special things starting to happen. It was easy to get hooked and Milwaukee is definitely a baseball city (and more recently a baseketball city again) in an ocean of Packers faithful, and while the ride has been interesting at times I feel like we have been quite fortunate in what we have here, and I'll continue to tell anyone who wants to listen the same. I have many fears about the playoffs but also more confidence than I have ever felt around this team, even in the heady past of 2008 and 2011 and our runs 2018+. I spend enough time worrying about the potential bad shit headed our way, I don't need to do that in baseball too so I am going to enjoy this as much as possible while knowing it can end in a moment. But until that moment, as Murph says, the opponent is gonna feel us and know we didn't quit.",https://reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1nveoep/reflections_on_this_season/nhad52d/,2025-10-02T01:00:46+00:00,Yankees,1414

reddit_post,Brewers,Shoddy_Act7059,"2025 Brewers Appreciation Post \[NOTE: Really long -- and somewhat personal -- post. TLDR: Didn't know how to guage this team going after the...offseason we had, yet still felt optimistic; then, first four games (and then that first month and a half) and I felt like I was the only one who was optimistic; ""The Summer of Passion and Entertainment"" happened and I was ecstatic, especially while dealing with mental health issues; and now -- despite playing rather pedestrian since the big winning streak ended -- still excited for what this team has in store for October\] Hello everyone. Been lurking on here for a few months, and finally decided to post here with...well, what the title says. Truth be told, going into the first game of the season, I didn't really know what to expect. I just turned 22 earlier this month, so I don't have as much experience with the Brewers (or life in general, lol) compared to most of you on here. But, yeah, I just didn't know how to properly gauge this team. It had been an...interesting off-season to say the least. Trading away Devin for Caleb Durbin and Nestor (The Bull) Cortes -- points for anyone who gets that reference ;) -- and acquiring FA Jose Quintana and...Ueck...Man, that still hurts, even if it was inevitable. However, one thing for me was certain: despite quite a few saying the Brewers would be taking a step back, and possibly be under .500 (thanks, ESPN), I felt like this team could still do something in the playoffs -- particularly given what happened in the last few regular seasons. Then, those first games occured. Woof. Being a part of the Secret Base Nation site ""Brew Crew Ball"" (not sure if anyone on here also posts there, but yeah), I got witness any and all optimism most folks had there die off in the blink of an eye. Heck, I recall one of the most levelheaded people on there booing the team during that first Royals game. No way am I trying to discount how bad the team looked then, though. It. Was. UGLY. So much so that...I needed to take a break from it all. To be candid, I have Anxiety. It was diagnosed by a doctor some years back, and it has come and gone in waves, but (given everything that's been happening within the last year or so), it's gone way back up. Not asking for any sympathy about this, just wanted to share it. Thus, with all this in mind, to see my team play the way it did, seeing everyone being miserable about that, and the way the world was at the time...I decided I needed to step back and focus on myself. I dreaded posting my 'leave of absence' on BCB (as we folks there call Brew Crew Ball) because of said anxiety making me think I was being a loser for doing it. But, seeing the support I got from *almost* everyone on there -- which I saw when I got back -- made me feel a lot better. I ended up taking a week off from baseball altogether, and rather slowly got back into it. However, if anyone remembers the beginning of the season (you'd be forgiven if you don't, lol), it still wasn't smooth sailing. Playing sloppily, many guys taking steps back, at least two players-only meetings? Yeah, it was rough. I don't recall what the response to all this on here was, but folks on BCB were thinking that we need to sell off at the deadline. It was like, after avoiding them for so long, our ship had finally slammed into an iceberg and was starting to sink. My anxiety was still pretty bad (though it had gotten better since my spring semester at Marquette University; school takes a lot of you sometimes, lol), and, once again, I wasn't quite sure how to feel about this team. However, I could feel a sense of optimism still lingering in my heart. As much as it hurt to be reminded of them, since they eliminated us in heartbreaking fashion in the *singular* Wild Card game, the 2019 Washington Nationals started 19-31 by May 23rd. After that, they went on a magical run to not only make the postseason, they went all the way and won the whole darn thing in, well, the strangest WS I've ever seen. The negative thoughts swirling through my head wanted me to join the others in their lines of thinking. But, I remember thinking back to what I was right before the start of the season and saying to myself: ""No, I may have given into this before, but I am not doing it again. This franchise has defied expectations several times before. Things suck now, yes, but it can and will get better."" In no way was I expecting myself to be right, especially in how drastic the turn was. It didn't happen fully right away, but -- entering June -- it was like the ""Brewers Magic, Baby!"" switch suddenly got flipped, and the team began to right the ship and patch up the damage. Not only that, they began to restore everything to near perfect order. Frelick got it going; Durbin and Collins suddenly became two of the best rookies in the league; the additions of Priester and Vaughn helping us instantly; Mis showing up and dominating to start his career; Yeli turning back time again; and the pitching returning to mostly normal? Yeah, probably doesn't need to be said, but it was ***magical***. Perhaps literally; we don't know if Ueck really is pulling the strings in heaven or something, haha. Perhaps most shocking of all, my anxiety began to dissipate again. It was probably mostly due to how good the team was playing, of course. But, I also feel like my courage and determination to be optimistic about the 2025 Brewers, in spite of how they started, quietened the negative thoughts inside my brain. I was awestruck, to be honest. All the way through mid-August or so, the team kept on flying. To the point where we not only got free burgers from George Webb, but also achieved the longest winning streak in franchise history. Even after the big streak ended, the vibe surrounding the team completely changed. Instead of being mid and likely selling, we added. Yeah, the deadline additions of Shelby Miller and especially Danny Jansen didn't turn out to be major success, but, again, Quinn and Andrew made up for it. Now, it wasn't just playoffs we were playing for, it was division titles and top seeds in the not just the NL, but the entire league. The team definitely cooled off in September, but...we still accomplished all those goals. It still feels a little surreal, but it feels so good all the same. As of writing, we are about to see the final game of this 2025 MLB season for the Brewers, and they are currently sitting at 96-65, with the possibility of achieving the highest win total in franchise history to top off this magnificent regular season. Of course, the postseason now lies ahead, and many folks are obviously worried about what'll happen in said playoffs again. I am, too, don't you worry; but, the anxiety is not as prevalent as it was in me for the last couple of years. Yes, this team could be a one and done once again, and that would absolutely suck. But, even if that happens, and hopefully it doesn't, I'll still remember this team for the joy and amazement it brought me this year/summer -- especially in how it helped with my anxiety in an...unorthodox way, lol. If you made it all the way, I sincerely thank you. I am working on becoming an English major at University right now (likely going into copy-writing, technical writing or even grant-writing afterwards with a dream of writing novels sprinkled in there), and I love to write, if that wasn't glaringly obvious, haha. Maybe I'll even see a Brewers WS before I graduate next spring. Who knows? Anyways, stay safe, folks, and have a good one.

reddit_comment,Brewers,EnderCN,"There was no reason to think this team would win fewer than 88 games before the season. They won 93 games last year, replaced Rea with Quintana, Cortes had been more valauble than Williams so that was a wash at worst. Losing Adames wasn't likely to be a 5 win loss and all of the 2nd year players should have gotten better. Yelich and Hoskins were both likely to be healthier this season as well.

reddit_post,Brewers,daviddm1990,"Planning a trip to Wisconsin to catch games on 2026 Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a Brazilian fan planning a trip to Wisconsin in September 2026. My goal is to catch both a Brewers home game and a Packers game in the same trip. Looking at the Brewers schedule: ‚Ä¢ Sept 4‚Äì6 (Fri‚ÄìSun) they‚Äôre on the road. ‚Ä¢ That makes me think the Packers could very well open the NFL season at Lambeau on that first weekend (Sept 6). ‚Ä¢ Then on Sept 7 (Mon), the Brewers start a home series against the Cubs. ‚Ä¢ The following weekend (Sept 12‚Äì13), the Brewers are at home again, which pretty much rules out the Packers playing at Lambeau that weekend. So here‚Äôs my question: do you think it‚Äôs reasonable to assume the Packers will open the season at home on Sept 6? If so, it would be perfect ‚Äî I could watch the Packers on Sunday in Green Bay and then head down to Milwaukee right after to catch the Brewers too, while the beat the FIBs.

reddit_comment,Brewers,Born-Matter-2182,"Sounds like the experts who know him far better than any fan (or journalist?) have decided he makes the roster. It appears they think he is capable of growing from the experience, particularly if he fails. There is a known risk with him when things go sideways regarding composure and control, a consequence of where he‚Äôs at in his development. And, a trait we have not witnessed in Gasser or Hall with a similar frequency. A clean inning with a quick hook is the ideal scenario based on his recent performances. If they are leaving Hoskins off the roster and going with Lockridge on a 14 pitcher and 12 player roster then there is a spot for Miz as a power right hander in a middle inning bridge role. There is no easy decision here. I have been wondering for a while now about his control in bull pen sessions versus live batters, is it the game pressure that causes him to begin to miss badly when things don‚Äôt go right? Is there any way they could begin running him through some simulated leverage situations against live hitters? I think the kid develops and becomes a significant part of the team‚Äôs future and want whatever the experts think is the better pathway to get him to that point whether he is on the roster this season or not.",https://reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1nvndlb/where_does_miz_fit_into_the_brewers_postseason/nha2f4v/,2025-10-01T23:56:46+00:00,Brewers,1242

reddit_comment,Brewers,peckx063,"Yeli has a better chance than people think. He was sort of written off after his prolonged slump. The milestone I have been eyeballing is the 300/300 club. 8 players ever have done that and 6 of them are HoFers (if Beltran gets in which I think he will this year in a down ballot). If he can somehow stay healthy for 3 more seasons and find 67 more HR and 79 more SB (which is the tougher part), he'd have a pretty strong case. That would mean 3 more above average seasons and his total WAR would start to get close to 60 where it needs to be (at 45 now). He has the extreme 2 year MVP level peak which usually helps the borderline cases get in. His slump coincides with covid and I think there's a chance he looks more favorable through a historical lens. He may get a break for his career slump as we don't really know what 2020 could have been if covid didn't exist. Lastly, a World Series would probably help!",https://reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1ntqa55/next_brewers_hofer/nh0jm7p/,2025-09-30T14:41:36+00:00,Brewers,913

reddit_comment,Brewers,Cyprus_is_on_Fire,"Not to mention, I'd say he's definitely the best defensive 1B of the 3 we have. No idea what the advanced metrics say or if they'd support that statement, but those metrics say Collins is a superb outfielder, so I go by what I see lol. He had a couple scuffed plays on fly balls out in foul ground, but even that was maybe twice. He's nabbed a ton of hard line drives like snatching a bullet out of the air, he's 100% the best with the picks. Ngl, Turang's throwing accuracy has been notably worse this year (not bad, just not up to his '24 standards) and with Ortiz still coming into the SS role has really climbed in skill, but those picks/throws on those difficult plays from SS and 3B will often net you a less-than-perfect throw to 1b and he makes those difficult picks most of the time, which Bauers and Hoskins it felt like 50/50 on a good day. Not entirely their fault if the throw is off, but Vaughn just makes those much more consistently. And the easy, routine plays, it felt like Hoskins/Bauers (esp Hoskins) would botch a bit more than they should, whereas Vaughn has been solid. A few mistakes, but well within reason as that's inevitable at 1b with how many throws are coming to them. But he's got great determination and baseball IQ there. He's not exactly fast and nimble, but he hustles on plays and is very decisive 99% of the time. I really like that he is not lazy over there and how often he rushes the bag. He only feeds the ball to the pitcher when absolutely necessary and doesn't take unnecessary risks. How many times in the past we've seen easy outs botched from pitchers (even good ones) fumbling a softly tossed feed to 1b, or the toss be off the mark because it can be deceptively difficult to judge a pitcher's speed, pathing, and other fielding habits. He just eliminates the middleman. And when you got guys like Misiorowski, that mentality from Vaughn undoubtedly saved runs/outs. Obviously his offensive contributions needs no discussion, but I think he's definitely earned a defensive nod as well. He's firing on all cylinders. All that's left is to send someone over to NY to steal Jesse Winker's Rogaine for him.",https://reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1ntdmtm/andrew_vaughn_appreciation_post/ngu1mcp/,2025-09-29T14:35:15+00:00,Brewers,2151

reddit_comment,Brewers,GleamingAlloy_Aircar,"Mine renewed tonight as well. Last day of the Milwaukee Brewers broadcast season, and they charged me already for the spring training broadcasts that don't start until March. No email notification even thought their subscriber agreement specifically states: *4. Subscription and Auto-Renewal* *Your subscription to the Service may include enrollment into an ongoing/recurring payment plan. In such event, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the billing period you choose, unless cancelled in accordance with the instructions for cancellation below. Payment will be charged to your chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase and at the start of every new billing period, unless cancelled. You can turn off this auto-renewal by canceling your subscription as described below.* ***You will be notified at least thirty (30) days prior to renewal of an annual subscription or season pass subscription, as applicable, at the email you maintain as part of your account information. The renewal notice will include the amount and date of the upcoming renewal payment.*** It appears that they skipped this notification email entirely. Besides the fact that their interface is seriously lacking during the broadcasts, this is just a punch in the gut to find an alternative for next season... and that might just mean giving in and subscribing to Spectrum because their network is included on that subscription. Ugh.",https://reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1nt5nvp/fanduel_charging_for_next_season_subscription/ngrn7nf/,2025-09-29T03:14:52+00:00,Brewers,1433

I missed very few games. But I held on, and these fellas competed and played for each other, and now I am one of the most spoiled sports fans of all time. Also, I knew about Bob Uecker‚Äôs character on Mr. Belvedere before I knew he had anything to do with baseball.

reddit_comment,Brewers,riverfish72,"No reseeding, as others mentioned, but the rationale given by MLB makes no sense whatsoever: From MLB.com: Are teams reseeded after the Wild Card Series? . No. The No. 1 seed will face the winner of the Wild Card Series between the Nos. 4/5 seeds, while the No. 2 seed will face the winner of the Nos. 3/6 series. This ensures that the No. 1 seed won't face another division winner in the Division Series round while still preserving the bracket system. --- There is no possible re-seeding scenario in which a #1 would face a division winner, as the 3rd division winner is automatically the 3-seed, and thus could not be the lowest remaining seed- could only be the 4, 5, or 6 seed traveling to face #1. The other MLB rule precludes seeding by record- What if a Wild Card winner from one division has a better record than a division winner from another? It doesn‚Äôt matter. The division winner takes precedence with regard to seeding.",https://reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1nvc2t7/nlds_opponents_no_reds/nh7hl8v/,2025-10-01T16:10:14+00:00,Reds,933

I have a feeling this may be downvoted to hell, but I think it needs to be said that these guys wanted it so bad and accomplished the goal of giving us extra baseball and we should be grateful. Whether they got in mostly because of a generational collapse or not, the bottom line is that they played good enough throughout the course of the year to get here. That is about all you can ask- just get to the dance and see what happens. MLB playoffs has always been, and will continue to be, a crapshoot. Look at the teams who will also end their seasons today- padres/cubs, Yankees/sox, and tigers/guards. You‚Äôre telling me that our team is on the same wavelength as the Yankees/Sox/padres/cubs? I would‚Äôve killed for the ability to say that at the start of the year, and they made it happen. The loss stings, but this is the first step in the right direction to sustained postseason success that we have seen in over a decade. All we can hope is that Krall and Tito are able to go to ownership now and convince them to build on this. Go get (and draft) some thumpers and win a few more games next year.

reddit_post,reds,camly75,"Former Reds in the Playoffs: A Writeup I've done this post each of the past eight years. This year I wasn't sure there was any point in doing it because, well, we've got 26 current Reds in the playoffs (woo). However, I ended up choosing to do it because (1) maybe it'll give us all another team to follow, (2) I just like writing it, and (3) I'm pretty sure you guys like it too. So here we go, the former Reds players, favorites or otherwise, who contributed to a playoff team this year. **Toronto Blue Jays** 1B Ty France 2024 France was the Reds' ""big"" swing at last year's trade deadline, coming over in a deal with the Mariners for a 21-year-old catcher. Though he had a few clutch hits, he finished his Reds tenure with a .292 OBP and played much worse defense than his reputation would have suggested. He signed a $1M contract with the Twins in the offseason and was flipped to Toronto at this year's trade deadline. He was a slightly below average hitter at each stop, and he finished the season on the IL SP Kevin Gausman 2019 Gausman pitched mostly in relief with the Reds, as he was believed at that point to be a failed starter. They acquired him from Atlanta after a disastrous start to his season, and they kickstarted his career in the pen. In 22.1 innings, Gausman had a 4.03 ERA and 3.17 FIP. He signed as a starter with the Giants that offseason, and after a solid 2020, he broke out in 2021, posting a 2.81 ERA and going to his first All Star Game. Prior to the 2022 season, he signed with Toronto and has been their ace ever since. He received Cy Young votes in 2022 and 2023, and he'll probably receive one this year too. RP Jeff Hoffman 2021-2022 Hoffman was a decent reliever and occasional starter for the Reds over two years, but he could never seem to get his walks in check and was let go as a free agent at the end of 2022. The Twins signed him first, but they also cut him at the end of Spring Training. Philly signed him 3 days later, and he‚Äôs found a home there. After an impressive 2023, Hoffman was even better last year, posting a 2.17 ERA and being named to his first All Star team. This year was his first as the Jays‚Äô closer, and despite saving 33 games, it was a pretty up and down season for him, as he finished with a 4.37 ERA **Seattle Mariners** 3B Eugenio Suarez 2015-2021 I miss this man. Geno brought his big smile and good vibes to the Reds dugout for 7 seasons, peaking with 49 homers in 2019. After a few down seasons, they packaged him with Jesse Winker and sent him off to Seattle. Jerry DiPoto shipped him off to Arizona prior to last season, and after a dreadful start, he got hot down the stretch. This season he's been hot from the get go, and as the D-Backs fell out of contention, he was squarely on the trade block. Though Reds fans hoped for a reunion in Cincinnati, he ended up back in Seattle, where he slumped but still finished the season tying his career-best 49 homers. He's got a real shot at hitting 400 bombs for his career 2B Donovan Solano 2022 Solano is just one in a long line of average Reds infielders who have earned a special place in my heart (Santiago Espinal is the current torch bearer.) A 2020 Silver Slugger, Solano missed the first half his one Reds season with injury but came out swinging, putting up a .838 OPS in his first 48 games before slumping like the rest of the team in September. He's bounced around quite a bit, but until this year has been a solidly above average hitter everywhere he's gone. Unfortunately, he was cut by the Mariners at the start of this month. The Rangers quickly snapped him up, but he only got into 2 games. It may be the end of the road for Donnie Barrels SP Luis Castillo 2017-2022 Castillo with his deadly changeup was the Reds‚Äô ace and a fan favorite for half a decade. In 2022, he was putting together perhaps his finest campaign. But with the team struggling, they shipped him to Seattle for a haul of prospects headlined by the guy who saved the season, Noelvi Marte. Castillo signed a long term extension with the Mariners, and he's continued to be a good if not great starter for them. RP Casey Legumina 2023-2024 It's always shocking which names turn up, and while this doesn't quite reach the level of Jackson Stephens resurfacing with the Braves, it's still a surprise. Legumina pitched 22 innings over two seasons with the Reds, posting an ERA near 7 and a walk rate of 4.5 per 9. This year, the walk rate was exactly the same for the Mariners, but pairing it with a 10.0 K/9 allowed The Big Legume (patent pending) to remain in the M's bullpen for the full season despite a 5.62 ERA. The Mariners' Fansided blog says he's one of 4 players who's played themselves off of a spot on the playoff roster, but Fansided is garbage so who knows **Cleveland Guardians** SP Ben Lively 2023 Lively was a Reds 4th rounder all the way back in 2013, but he was flipped a year later to the Phillies for Marlon Byrd. After flaming out and spending time in Korea, he made his way back to the Reds two seasons ago, making 12 starts with a 5.38 ERA, although that was a much more respectable 3.76 before being left to die and surrender 13 runs against the Cubs on August 1st. He found his way to Cleveland in the offseason and surprised many by being their number two starter in terms of both ERA and innings pitched. He made his first career postseason appearance in the ALCS, pitching well in mopup duty in a Game 2 loss. This season was off to another strong start, but unfortunately he was forced to undergo Tommy John Surgery in late May to repair his flexor tendon **New York Yankees** IF/OF Amed Rosario 2024 Rosario, a former top Mets prospect, was claimed off waivers by the Reds last year for the stretch run. He was absolutely dreadful for them, slashing .158/.186/.211 with 23 strikeouts in 57 at bats. The Nationals gave him a contract in the offseason, and he was actually kinda decent for them, putting up a 104 wRC+ in 47 games. They flipped him to the Yankees for a guy named Browm, and he went 10/33 as mostly a substitute in the Bronx. It's unlikely he'll see postseason action, but it is likely he'll remain a big leaguer after this season OF Austin Slater 2024 On the other hand, it's Austin Slater. Slater was acquired by the Reds last July for Alex Young. He was even worse than Rosario, slashing .111/.190/.111 in 8 games for a scale-breaking -15 wRC+. They cut their losses before the month was out, trading him to Baltimore for a PTBNL whom I believe still has not yet been named. He was a little better for the Orioles, and he even got a pinch hit single in a playoff game! This year, he was a league average bat for the White Sox, so the Yankees decided to trade for him. He was about as bad for them though as he was for the Reds, so it's unlikely he'll see any action this October. RP Luke Weaver 2023 Weaver was possibly the worst starting pitcher I‚Äôd ever seen in my Reds fandom, making 21 starts with a 6.87 ERA (yet inexplicably going two and a half full months without a loss.) In fact, it was the worst ERA *ever* by a Red who made at least 15 starts, with only 2003 Ryan Dempster in the same stratosphere. The Yankees liked what they saw though enough to give him a major league deal last January. And it sure paid off. As the team‚Äôs setup man, he posted a 2.89 ERA with a 0.929 WHIP and 11 K/9. He even stepped into the closer‚Äôs role in September, saving 4 regular season games and 4 more in the playoffs,. This year, he proved it wasn't a fluke, as he put up an ERA in the mid 3s and saved another 8 games RP Fernando Cruz 2022-2024 Cruz' splitter is genuinely one of the best pitches in the game. His road to the majors was long, but he finally made it as a 32-year-old in 2022. He rode that splitter to K/9 well above 13 in 2023 and 2024, but a combination of bad control and bad luck saw him put up ERAs near 5. This offseason, he was traded to the Yankees for backup catcher Jose Trevi√±o. Though the peripherals weren't quite as good as before, Cruz put up a career best 3.56 ERA and saved two games for the Yankees. He's one of their favored bullpen arms **Boston Red Sox** RP Aroldis Chapman 2010-2015 We all know who this guy is. But at age 37, he somehow put up the best season of his career this year. Chapman saved 32 games with a 1.17 ERA and 1.73 FIP. He's still averaging 98.4 mph on the fastball, and he even hit 103.8 once RP Justin Wilson 2021-2022; 2024 The Reds got Wilson and Luis Cessa from the Yankees to boost the bullpen at the 2021 trade deadline. The lefty was really solid down the stretch, pitching to a 2.81 ERA in 22 appearances. He was off to another solid start in 2022, but he was sidelined in April with Tommy John and missed the rest of the season. The Brewers signed him in 2023 and even were prepared to bring him into a game, but he injured himself warming up and never got in. Wilson re-signed with the Reds shortly before Opening Day last year, and he lasted most of the season in the pen, but that came with a 5.59 ERA. The Red Sox signed him in the offseason, and despite a high WHIP, he's been pretty good. He's going to be on a postseason roster for the first time in 7 years RP Jose De Leon 2020-2021 Once a consensus top 30 prospect with the Dodgers and Rays, De Leon was never able to get his control under, well, control. The Reds took a flier on him in 2020, but they couldn‚Äôt work their magic and fix him. In 24.1 innings over two seasons, he walked a shocking 22 batters and had a 10.73 ERA. He was out of the majors all 2022, but De Leon resurfaced with the Twins in 2023 as a mildly successful reliever. Unfortunately, he had his season cut short by a UCL tear and underwent Tommy John surgery in June. He spent all of 2025 in AAA Worcester before returning home to Puerto Rico. That is, until the Sox called and told him they needed someone to start Game 162. He lied and told them that he had been throwing, and he flew to Boston to face the Tigers. And he actually pitched pretty well! He went 6.2 innings and allowed 3 runs while striking out 8. Good for him **Detroit Tigers** RP Tanner Rainey 2018 Rainey pitched in 8 games for the 2018 Reds with a seemingly-impossible 24.43 ERA. And yet the following season, he pitched 4 times in the World Series for the Nationals. He gave up runs in two of them and nearly blew Game 1, but still. He stayed in the Nationals bullpen ever since, even briefly becoming their closer in 2022. This year, after a brief unsuccessful stint with the Pirates, he had a briefer unsuccessful-er stint with the Tigers. Though he pitched 2 good innings in yesterday's finale, it's unlikely he'll be on the playoff roster **Milwaukee Brewers** NONE **Philadelphia Phillies** RF Nick Castellanos 2020-2021 Castellanos put together a career year with the Reds in 2021, hitting 34 homers with a .939 OPS. Though he really wanted to come back, the team wouldn‚Äôt pony up the money, and he signed with Philly. With his new team, Castellanos was pretty terrible in his first season, putting together a sub-.700 OPS and a negative WAR, and he had just a .478 OBP during the Phillies‚Äô run to the World Series. His second season was quite a bit better, but he's declined each of the last two and was below replacement level this year as there‚Äôs a drive to deep left‚Ä¶ OF Harrison Bader 2023 Bader was a waiver claim by the Reds August 2023, but he slugged a miserable .194 in 14 games with the team. The Mets gave him a major league contract last year, and he got the majority of starts in center field for them, with his good defense buoying poor hitting. This year out of nowhere though has been his best all around season of his career. With Minnesota and later Philly, he put up a career-best .796 OPS and 4.2 bWAR in mostly center field. **Los Angeles Dodgers** C Chuckie Robinson 2022 The Reds used 7 catchers in 2022, each one worse than the last, and Robinson landed somewhere toward the middle-back. After spending 2023 with the Bats, he got into 26 games with the White Sox last year, and like the rest of the team he wasn't any good. He spent the first 2 months of this season with the Angels' AAA team before the Dodgers decided to claim him off waivers. He made it up to the majors for exactly one game this year, getting the start on September 15th and scoring a run after reaching on a fielder's choice RP Alexis Diaz 2022-2025 The brother of the Mets' Edwin, Alexis Diaz came out of nowhere in 2022 and quickly established himself as the Reds' closer. That first season, he had a 1.84 ERA and struck out 11.7 batters per 9 innings, though he had walk problems from the start. Each subsequent season got a little shakier, and after starting 2025 on the IL, he was never able to find his command after coming back. The Reds traded Diaz to the Dodgers at the end of May, and while his first four appearances went well, things quickly went south again. He was subsequently claimed off waivers by the Braves, and he only pitched 2.2 innings with them while giving up 3 earned runs **Chicago Cubs** NONE **San Diego Padres** SS Jose Iglesias 2019 A 2015 All Star in Detroit, Candelita came to the Reds on a minor league deal in 2019. He managed to win the starting shortstop job, hitting .288 with excellent infield defense and a career-best 11 homers. In the shortened 2020 season, he had an insane BABIP-fueled season with Baltimore in which he hit .373 and slugged over .550. He bounced around the next few years and spent all of 2023 in the minors before signing another minor league contract with the Mets prior to last season. He‚Äôs made the most of his chance, putting up a .842 OPS and apparently moonlighting as a pop star. This season was less kind to the 35-year-old, as he hit just .229 for the Padres. He's been really good this past month though, and he'll probably be on the postseason roster RP Wandy Peralta 2016-2019 Peralta was a steady middle reliever for the Reds when they sorely lacked steady middle relievers. He was waived in 2019 after struggling mightily for much of the year and claimed by San Francisco. The Giants used him each of the next three seasons to varying degrees of success. After 10 uninspiring appearances to start 2021, he was traded to the Yankees where he spent three superlative seasons near the back of their bullpen, although the peripherals were rough in 2023. Now with the Padres, he's picked up where he left off and been one of their better bullpen arms each of the last two years. **Cincinnati Reds** ALL OF THEM WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO So there you have it. The Yankees and Mariners have the most former Reds with 4. Good luck to all former Reds in the postseason, and better luck to all current Reds in the postseason!",https://reddit.com/r/Reds/comments/1ntla4z/former_reds_in_the_playoffs_a_writeup/,2025-09-29T15:36:01+00:00,Yankees,14723

reddit_comment,reds,stockmarketpundit,"Loved to see the fight til the end. We have to have solid starting pitching to win and Hunter shit the bed against the best sluggers that play on the defending WS champs team. Would have liked to see Tito pull him for Barlow before Teoscar blew the game open but it is what it is. Suter actually did decent to save our clutch pen guys for the next two night if needed. Barlow was lights out. Philips gave up a couple solo shots but otherwise was serviceable. Tomorrow, if Littell gives up a bomb or two, we need to pull him for Lodolo, even if it‚Äôs the first inning. Can‚Äôt let the Dodgers get ahead more than a couple to keep it competitive. Love this team and our guys. The fight in the later innings was nice to see as well as the plate discipline. We need to keep it up and believe. If we can get to a game 3, who the hell knows what can happen.

reddit_post,reds,AmbassadorCold5348,"The Reds got exposed‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not all bad I was right there drinking the bleach with the rest of you the last two nights, but honestly‚Ä¶ maybe this wasn‚Äôt the worst possible outcome compared to missing the playoffs entirely. Hear me out: **1. No false sense of security.** If we had finished the season by sweeping the Cubs, taking the Brewers‚Äô series, and then barely missing out because the Mets snagged the WC, we‚Äôd be sitting at 6‚Äì1 against 2 playoff teams and probably telling ourselves ‚ÄúAw shucks, we‚Äôll run it back next year.‚Äù That kind of mindset would‚Äôve let us gloss over the real issues. **2. National spotlight exposed the gaps.** Having the entire baseball world watch our ""cockroaches"" get stepped on really highlighted our lack of clutch hitting when compared to elite offenses. The Dodgers are on another pay scale, sure, but this was a reminder we can‚Äôt trick ourselves into thinking we‚Äôre close. **3. Playoff experience matters.** Even if it was short-lived, this team got a taste of October baseball. They now know what the stage feels like and what doesn‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs something to build on going forward, especially for Burns and Stewart. I don‚Äôt see us signing any big names, but this ending won't let front office will just sit on their hands. More likely we‚Äôll see the usual ‚Äúunder-the-radar guy with upside‚Äù signings, and hope a couple of them hit.

reddit_comment,reds,Ok_Opportunity_2299,"Chill. Tito squeezed blood out of a turnip this year. Even making it to October 1st was playing with house money. If I have any complaint, it's the consistent unproductive at-bats with RISP(runners in scoring position 'for the newbies'). To ME, it seems you should have a component hitting coach who emphasizes simply making contact in play with the bases juiced up on mountain dew. Watching a 3rd strike, or swinging at a ball outside of the zone with the bases loaded is not only unacceptable, but probably also a result of poor preparation for the at- bat. But wtf do I know. No one has thrown a 100mph fastball followed by a splitter that drops off the table at me ALL DAY.

reddit_post,reds,EllyDeLaGOAT,"[Serious/Kooky] A Metaspiritual Tactic for the Reds to Win the World Series in 2025 (Future Legendary Thread) I‚Äôm still in shock that it actually happened and that this team either stormed its way through sheer force of will and Tito Devil Magic, or stumbled ass backwards into another lousy Cincinnati series in October that we collectively memoryhole by 2027. Either way, it happened, and I think we all knew that all they had to do was stay in the race and pump the gas at the right time. I think we also know that this team feeds on energy, almost as if they‚Äôre a brain and we‚Äôre the neurons collectively firing around inside of the stadium and city and state and river valley region. We are the Reds just as much as they are the Reds, and if you ask them, they will tell you the same thing. They know how much we care and how much we want to see our team finally reach the top again (or in my case, for the first time ever - literally, i was born in 1996). They know how much it means, not only to them as athletes and business strategists but everything in between, and everything on the outside too. Essentially what I‚Äôm saying is that sports teams function as a collective hivemind, and all we need to do is use CIA intelligence techniques to quickly internalize a common mantra. This common mantra will be something easily memorable, short, and repeatable. The goal here is to literally become a crazy person telling yourself some affirmation or mantra over and over. I think we should choose ‚ÄúJust get Red.‚Äù I would say just get hot, but other teams can say this too. We are Red, collectively, and when we channel our energy through the color Red and the idea of Red, which indicate heat and warmth, it sends signals in the form of an element that humans cannot consciously perceive, to the players, and it directly influences their performance on the field. That‚Äôs been the goal this entire season it seems. We knew by May the division was a wash, so it was always play strategically to optimize players health and efficiency until the Mets (who are also plagued by a cloud of negative collective energy) crumble and this team can just slide on in and go on a scorcher. Maybe Tito has devil magic after all. He does look like he might be into the dark arts, and honestly, it‚Äôd be really cool if he was. But even if Tito isn‚Äôt truly a devil master pulling a vast network of interconnected baseball strings, we can still collectively meme this team into the history books. We need all of us‚Ä¶ I mean ALL of us, to systematically incorporate the mantra ‚ÄúJust get Red.‚Äù into our lives over the next couple of days. Send it to the team on socials, share it all over baseball forums as a rally cry, make funny memes of it. I am doing my part as and after I type this. Any repetition of this mantra is good. Any positive stimulus in association with the repetition only strengthens the energy of the mantra. Repetition synthesizes knowledge. Pleasure stimulates that knowledge into collective action.

E.g., the Marlins approached the series more professionally than the Mets did. As a result, the Marlins get to take their pictures and enjoy ending the season on a high note.

reddit_post,reds,PigScarf,"Odds Using current betting lines (which I understand are imperfect, but it is a decent reflection of the general betting marketplace's sentiment) of Brewers -135 and Mets -130... Mets clinching odds: 33.5%, which would be the odds that BOTH the Brewers and Mets win, which would be the intersection of an implied 57.45% odds of MIL winning AND NYM implied 56.5% odds of winning. Probability would say that there is a 32.5% chance of both happening. Reds clinching odds: 71.9%, which would be the odds that either a 46.5% implied odds of the Reds winning OR 47.6% implied odds that Miami wins.

reddit_comment,reds,Waterfish3333,"The Mets are in a far bigger market than the Reds so they‚Äôll naturally get talked about more in national media, plus they are playing well below .500 ball since the ASG, at 27-36. If they played just .500 (which we have, exactly .500), we would already be eliminated mathematically and in fact there wouldn‚Äôt be any playoff drama this week for the NL, just questions of seeding. That‚Äôs the reason this is being talked about as a collapse. Being .500 is generally considered the norm, we‚Äôve played right to the norm so nothing special (for all those wins, we dropped 2/3 against the Pirates and got swept by the Nomads‚Ä¶ err‚Ä¶ sorry‚Ä¶ Athletics).

reddit_post,reds,brothste8,"Plea to Management Dear Mr. Castellini, As I‚Äôm sure you know, on February 10, 2000, Ken Griffey Jr. was traded to Cincinnati. That was the moment my bond with the Reds began. Immediately my 10-year-old self *had* to have that jersey.The red and black pinstripes, remember? Those were awesome. Please bring those back. Anyways, since that day I have lived and died along with the club. I know the name of the pitcher that Jay Bruce took deep to win the 2010 division (Tim Byrdak), and I remember the back-breaking Grand Slam Mat Latos allowed to Buster Posey in the 2012 NLDS. No joke, I was in a bad mood for a week. And I know, I know. In the grand scheme of things, the success of a team of people I‚Äôve never met is hilariously stupid, but for whatever reason, it matters to millions of us. I want the Cincinnati Reds to *win.* Like, a lot. And I know you do too. I don‚Äôt doubt for a moment that you‚Äôre a passionate Reds fan.But sir, if you don‚Äôt love it that much, if wins aren‚Äôt the sweetest thing and losses don‚Äôt hurt equally as much, then please, sell the team. I totally understand that owning a baseball team must be the coolest thing ever. But as a Reds fan, isn‚Äôt your foremost priority to succeed? The only way to do that is unfortunately with money. It was obvious after watching this Wild Card series that the Reds cannot currently compete with the Dodgers‚Äô deep pockets. The cumulative talent just isn‚Äôt the same. That‚Äôs just reality. I don‚Äôt say that as an insult. I do give you credit, Mr. Castellini. You‚Äôve presided over some great moments in franchise history and pushed the organization in a positive direction. The team has always been competitive under your stewardship, but we have to be honest ‚Äì they need a star player or two to push them over the edge. You wouldn‚Äôt remember me, but we‚Äôve briefly chatted a few times at the annual Reds Spring Training event in Arizona. You seem like a nice guy and I wish you nothing but success, but I implore you to invest more into the team. Respectfully sir, if you can‚Äôt, please make room for someone who can. If you won‚Äôt, please pass the baton to someone who will. This letter was written with reason, not spite, on behalf of millions of Reds fans who just want to see the team earn another ring. I think the team is close. I really do. So please, Mr. Castellini, do whatever needs to be done to bring us a winner in Cincinnati .Just once I‚Äôd like to be able to tell my brother, the Cubs fan, to shove it.

A team that boasted of a young superstar in Elly de la Cruz who played in all 162 games but struggled to deliver when it counted. A team with the young pitching phenom, Hunter Greene, who recently flirted with a no-hitter and was either locked-in or gave up multiple home runs and not able to last past three innings. A team that squeaked into the third wild card spot when most believed they couldn‚Äôt get there. A team that claimed they were like roaches and couldn‚Äôt be killed. What went wrong?

reddit_post,reds,cjj1224,"Reds Hitters If you look at the overwhelming majority of our lineup, almost every hitter started their young careers hitting better their first meaningful year of playing time vs their next year or two where there was a significant drop off in almost every statistical category, especially average. MLB pitching catches up very quickly when you now have significant film and stats on these batters. It seems with the Reds it is very rare that our hitters can then adjust to how they are now being pitched and get those stats back up to what they were when they were hitting well in their first meaningful year of playing time. I‚Äôm not sure what needs to change to fix that, whether it‚Äôs better coaching or the players having better analysis of pitchers tendencies on how they now throw to them in certain counts, etc. I know Reds fans gave Votto crap for power numbers and all that but this guy was a freakin machine. We may never see another hitter come through Cincinnati like him ever again. You could tell he was a student of the game when it came to hitting and it‚Äôs pretty unreal he was able to maintain that consistent average of around .300 for years beyond his first meaningful season of games. Maybe Votto needs to share what he did to maintain his hitting with these young guys. We will never progress if this continues to happen where our guys start out hitting 50 points higher the prior year and basically can‚Äôt ever get back out of that rut. You can‚Äôt tell me they just aren‚Äôt capable. They did it their first year. Why can‚Äôt they get back to that? If I was a Reds hitting coach, my very first instruction to these players would be to sit fastball and swing the damn bat when one is thrown in the zone. It‚Äôs embarrassing to see our guys take fastballs, sometimes right down the pipe, only to swing at garb the next pitch. It‚Äôs almost guaranteed this type of approach will add points to your average in the long run.

reddit_comment,reds,DigiQuip,"\>If I was a Reds hitting coach, my very first instruction to these players would be to sit fastball and swing the damn bat when one is thrown in the zone. It‚Äôs embarrassing to see our guys take fastballs, sometimes right down the pipe, only to swing at garb the next pitch. I don't think a lot of people in here understand how hitting works. Good pitchers can make their slider look exactly like a fastball up til the last moment when it breaks away. Disguising pitches has become an art the majority of MLB caliber pitchers are at least decent at. 90% of choosing when to swing comes down to understanding how pitchers sequence pitches and what their tendencies are with different pitch counts. You can get hints about a pitch based on arm slot and angle as well as how the ball comes out of the pitchers hand. But even this, only a handful of guys in all of MLB history are what you might consider ""good"" at identifying very insignificant distinctions. It's not easy identifying a pitch before you have to commit to swinging or not. And now that the average pitcher can throw 95+ with ease, this has only gotten more difficult. So when you see a hitter take a fastball, it's because they're not expecting a fastball. When you see them swing at a slider that was never in the strike zone at any point, it's because they were sitting fastball. It's mostly an ""educated"" guessing game.",https://reddit.com/r/Reds/comments/1nw6yim/reds_hitters/nhec2jt/,2025-10-02T17:20:06+00:00,Reds,1385

It is just out of our range. I think instead I am looking at a reunion with Geno, he struggled in Seatle to end the season and I think his value is much more attainable. I am looking at a 3/45 with probably a mutual option and buyout in year 3. Next need that needs to be addressed is left field. I don't like Hays because of injuries and I don't like Lux because of his defense. Realistically, I would rather this be a Right Handed bat, but either can do. I do not like the market for this addition, but I think the Red Sox make a super interesting trade partner. Roman Anthony is their RF and Cedanne is their CF. That leaves Duran and Abreu to fight over LF, I would be willing to trade one of our young controllable starters to add that bat. In particular I would be looking at Lowder + a couple other prospects for Duran. This is a wash money wise. Losing Lowder, Martinez, and Littel means we need to go back into the market and get another starter and a multi inning reliever. I would bet on getting more juice out of Gallen on the market. Spotrac has his value at 18 mil AAV. Lets round it up to 20 mil for probably 3-5 years with options and buyouts. Then I sign Michael Soroka for a couple mil as a multi inning bullpen option. Also I try to catch and save the falling star of Devin Williams and reunite him with Derrick Johnson with the remaining like 8 million. This plan doesn't include depth signings and bringing guys in as camp invites. Roster wise this leaves us with: SP: Greene, Lodolo, Abbott, Gallen, Singer, Burns with depth options of Williamson, Spiers, Miley, Petty, Aguiar (unproven depth is a concern BP: Suter, Soroka, Maxwell, Phillips, Williams, Ashcraft, Barlow, Santillan (biggest concern is youth and not having a true lefty. I hope Moll can return to that or that would be a deadline target. Ashcraft and Suter works as a good stopgap to start the year.) Lineup: Friedl CF Marte RF Elly SS Geno DH Stewart 1B Duran LF Stephenson C McLain 2B Hayes 3B Bench: Steer (Util 1B, 2B, 3B, LF), Trevino, Lux (2B, LF), Benson (OF) Lineup Concerns - McLain sucks and we have to start Lux and/or Steer there. Definitely a spot to add veteran minimum guys for competition, I just couldn't find a good option and I do believe in him to turn it around.

reddit_comment,reds,No_Buy2554,"Priority 1- Bull pen refresh. Some of this comes internally. Maxwell and Mey should be ready full time. Williamson and Aguiar are back and can go into the pen to ease back from their injuries. Phillips can hopefully develop some more. Let Barlow go and bring in a coule of vet guys. Don't need superstars, but need to fill the gaps. One off the wall bullpen idea, and this is very conditional. IF, emphasis on if, Chase Burns can't develop a third pitch this offseason, make him the 2026 closer. They would still have a good 5 man rotation in Green-Lodolo-Singer-Abbott-Lowder, this gives Burns another year to work on a third pitch, and he could be a knockout closer with the 2 he has. Again, only for one year, and only under that condition. Priority 2- Left field. It does not have to be a superstar bat necessarily, but a really good one that does not have to platoon wpuld be great. The outfield needs to stop being a shuffle around point and get guys some defined positions. I haven't gone fully through the options for trade or signing yet, but going Friedl in CF, Marte in right and pickup in left every day, except for occasional rest would be a huge upgrade. Rodriguez can be the 4th guy. Andujar would be great if he could stay healthy enough, but we may need to go elsewhere because of that. Priority 3- Lock down catcher. Ty would be in his last year, and has not seemed amicable yet toward an extension, so an offseason trade is probably the move. Get something back for him while we can. I would like to see if the Reds could use some of their young pitching to pry Adley away from the O's, as he would get an extra year to bridge to Duno. As for other moves, not too many names I'd be sure of as target yet, but some general things I'd look for. As mentioned above, reduce platoons wherever I can. Let Tito start being able ot have a reliable 1-9 that can play almost every day, rely on the bench to rest those guys, not to have to be important aspects of the team. REDUCE STRIKEOUTS!!! Starting to look at the stats for the season as whole and the K's are standing far and above as the #1 obstacle of this offense. Anyone who comes in needs to have a low K rate, and guys who are staying need to reduce theirs. Needs to be the big priority on offense.",https://reddit.com/r/Reds/comments/1nw43w5/youre_the_gm_this_offseason_what_would_you_do/nhd6so7/,2025-10-02T14:00:14+00:00,Reds,2268

reddit_comment,reds,Petkorazzi,"Hadn't seen anyone mention this, but - see what the actual *fuck* is going on with coaching. Despite the complaining, there **is** legitimate talent on this team. Despite some issues this year (and frankly choking in his last game) Greene absolutely has Cy Young Award level talent. Elly is the archetype of ""generational talent."" Ke'Bryan Hayes is amazing defensively and I think the bat potential is very much there. Despite a long history of great pitchers with the Reds I've been hearing ""the Reds ain't got no pitching"" my whole life - well, just look at this bullpen. Abbot is in the Top 20 pitchers in the entire league by average against; Pagan is an iceman of a closer; Nicky almost had a no-no this year (though I think it being broken up shattered him mentally); Santillan pitched in 77 games (!) and only gave up runs in 15 of them. But we lost games. Sometimes badly. Why? *Coaching*. Some observations I've had: 1. Complete lack of basepath aggression. Elly had 30 fewer stolen bases this year compared to last. Steer had 25 SBs last year and only 7 this year. Espinal went from 11 to 2. The Reds had 207 stolen bases in the 2024 regular season, but only 105 this year. In situations with runners in scoring position, they went from 62 to 28. 2. A shift from high-risk, high-reward strategies to a more ""traditional"" offense. AVG, OBP, and BB were all up from 2024 while HR and K were down. SLG is up year-to-year on average, but this was mainly carried by Marte and the Reds are below the league average. They were in the bottom 7% of the league for average exit velo. And despite this strategic shift, the Reds were still above average in whiffs. They swung less, but were below league averages for contact when they did - particularly when the ball was in the zone, where **the Reds had the second-worst zone pitch swing percentage in the league** (only the Brewers were worse). 3. Having bad hitters hit, especially at bad times: 1. We gave Candelario 80 ABs at the beginning of the season and he had 9 hits. ***Nine.*** That's an AVG of .113. For comparison, Bill Bergen - the all-time worst hitter in baseball with more than 2,500 career ABs - had an AVG of .170. If Candelario had had 15 more games with no hits, he would've tied Jim Abbott's all-time AVG. Jim Abbott was a pitcher. He also *only had one hand.* Also, he first dipped below .120 after an 0-4 Mariners game on April 17th. Response? Give him five ABs *the very next game*. He played 15 games with an AVG under the Mendoza line (14 of those consecutive) for a return of 3 hits in 55 ABs. 2. McLain. 4th worst AVG and OPS of all qualified players in MLB at the end of the regular season. 8th highest K% in the league. 577 appearances at the plate, most of which were at the #2 spot. 3. Lux had a career AVG as a pinch-hitter prior to this season of .176 in 64 attempts; his last year at the Dodgers was his busiest year pinch hitting and his AVG was .208. Tito had him pinch hit 7 times this year. The first one was the Reds trailing 0-1 in the 9th against the Brewers with two outs and nobody on base - and Gavin Lux is sent in. Yes, Tito eneded up getting lucky - of Lux's 7 attempts at PH he got 2 hits and two BBs for a season pinch hit AVG of .286 and an OBP of .444, all above league averages, and a walk-off single to boot. 4. Pitchers having mental-game issues. Martinez was the poster boy for it this season, with him either being near-unhittable or getting absolutely shelled. Singer started off hot but collapsed badly mid-season (though he redeemed himself with a good August). We all saw what happened to Greene too. Sorry Tito, but the old-time ball strategy isn't gonna work.",https://reddit.com/r/Reds/comments/1nw43w5/youre_the_gm_this_offseason_what_would_you_do/nhe9n10/,2025-10-02T17:08:37+00:00,Reds,3673

I‚Äôm following Kentucky Wildcats football and the Charlotte Hornets are my NBA team. I am sports abused so my standards are low. The fact that the modern Reds occasionally get in the playoffs and the Bengals got in back-to-back AFC championships and played in a Super Bowl a few years back both feel like miracles.

The owners (past and present) have allowed an entire generation to grow up knowing almost literally zero Postseason success.

Before my next statement, I think Nick Krall actually understands and has been trying to turn the tide. But this ownership group thinks you fix things on an MLB level.

reddit_post,reds,guerillacropolis,"Whatever happens with the Dodgers (still hopeful for a series win) this still sharpens Reds for future playoff appearances in coming years Look, it's David vs Goliath right now. We are battling the World Series Champs of 2024. And yes, crazier things have happened than two wins after a brutal loss against a seemingly stronger opponent. But even if the Reds DON'T win the series, they're still preparing themselves for future playoff appearances in coming years. Maybe a future Hunter Greene will feel calmer at the mound (dude was even pitching in his hometown of LA--that's gotta be a mindfuck). The rally could start earlier against strong pitching. Heck, with a better regular season record, maybe the Reds could even get some home games early on. I know it feels premature to even think about 2026. But this is how teams build grit and calm even during the playoffs. They get there and get through the first experience to build for future ones. This ain't the Dodgers' first rodeo, after all. And that gives them a lot of confidence. And one last thing. This is a team of roaches. They're hard to kill. Don't count them out til the last out. It only takes one big inning.

Think Fubo is usually 7, etc. Same with Youtube TV. You could link those together the right way to cover the whole playoff time I believe. So if you just need it for a short time, might be a good time to use one of those for ESPN (then TBS, etc).

reddit_post,reds,SigmaSeal66,"Playoff roster I know it's jumping the gun, but just for fun! Roster currently stands at 28, but has to go back to 26 for the post season, so two guys have to be removed. Maxwell is an obvious choice for one of them, as he hasn't pitched lately and I don't see a role for him, but who is the other? Some thoughts: Espinal is an obvious choice, since he's hardly played in the stretch run. But I do see a potential role for him. If you might want to hit for Hayes or McLain, you might want his defense over Stewart at one of those spots in the late innings. And if Kershaw pitches, you won't start Lux or Benson, and you might actually need him to start in LF if Hays can't go and Andujar's legs still aren't up to playing OF, limiting him to DH. Espy still has one of the team's top averages against left handed pitchers, they just haven't faced any lately. If Hays' back is still balky, maybe he's the one. My understanding is that if you just leave him off the roster he can return for the next round, but if he starts the series on the active roster and then needs to be replaced, he has to go on the regular IL and be out the full 10 days, which would cost him the next round too. Suter hasn't been used lately and seems to have lost Tito's confidence, or at least fallen in the pecking order, but with LA's two big lefty hitters (Ohtani and Freeman) I can't see going without a lefty reliever. Ordinarily I couldn't see going into a 3-game series with 5 starting pitchers, maybe 4 to have one for emergency long relief, but Lodolo's groin is a wild card there. Depending on how his health is and how long Singer pitches Sunday, I could see Singer, Lodolo, or Littell being left off the roster (to return in round 2, when we get to have this discussion all over again). Whatever the choice, it's fun just to have to think about it.",https://reddit.com/r/Reds/comments/1nrpwq9/playoff_roster/,2025-09-27T08:24:42+00:00,A's,1835
