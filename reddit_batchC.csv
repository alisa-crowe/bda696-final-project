reddit_comment,Dodgers,atducker,We have to face the fact that Blake and Tanner are likely to be high leverage guys in the post season. They didn't just roll them out night after night and watch them fail just to not use them in October. They'd have cut their losses a long time ago. Something tells them it will work out and the rest of us just do not believe in it. We can limit that by scoring a bunch of runs and never letting up on defense. The trick for the Dodgers in this and many postseasons will be to limit damage. You're going to give up a run here or there but you have to avoid the big damage innings that not only put the game out of reach but tax the pitcher. The post season is just a whole new monster. Every guy on that team has bought in to doing the role they need in that moment to survive to the next game until there are no more games. This is a winning machine and a dynasty in the making. We won't win every year but we know what it takes to win and that gives us a huge advantage.,https://reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1nspl5m/last_day_of_the_regular_season_and_so_much_in_the/ngnjvy4/,2025-09-28T14:26:30+00:00,Mets,974

reddit_comment,Dodgers,underyou271,"I've been grinding mental gears on the bullpen thing all season (well since June). There is so much talent in the pen, but the variation in outcomes has been extreme. Every pitcher that's ever pitched in the MLB has outings where they just get rocked. But it's seemed like the Dodgers bullpen has had a season where guys got rocked more often than normal and at the worst possible moments. Was it because of the cumulative effects of overuse from the early part of the season when they lacked starters (and also had a bunch of 3-inning starts)? Was it because some of the veterans have lost their stuff, independent of that overuse (Treinen, Scott)? Was it because guys were injured so often they couldn't get into a smooth routine? Last night showed what a top-talent bullpen like the Dodgers' is capable of when the stars align. That won't happen again (last time was like 1920 or something), but the average outcome should still be pretty good. Roberts is a guy who puts his players in situations to earn or regain his trust, so that they are ready for truly critical moments. That can be frustrating for fans in regular season games when he puts a shaky Treinen out there with a 1-run lead, (or insists on playing Conforto when he's still on the interstate in August... but this comment is about pitching haha). We saw Scott kind of continue to fail to regain that trust, and to a lesser extent Treinen. Either way it helps Roberts know what he's got when all the chips are on the table. Randomness obviously also plays a big part. But I feel like the Dodgers are well positioned to win their wildcard series, and then we'll see what happens...

reddit_comment,Dodgers,um_chili,"Mets have vastly more talent (from a payroll perspective at least) so there‚Äôs the chance they could turn it on in the playoffs and if they play as well as they seem to be able to could be dominating. But if after 161 games that hasn‚Äôt happened, seems unlikely to emerge in the next series. Reds aren‚Äôt as full of name talent but they are sneaky-good and a more cohesive unit. Mets are an impressive-on-paper sum of their parts, Reds are a superior whole. Either way I am cautiously optimistic with an emphasis on cautiously. I believe in this Dodgers team and they‚Äôre playing well recently but a best-of-three is so subject to random variation.

Leaving Dodger Stadium that day no one‚Äî100% absolutely no one‚Äîwould have thought that after blowing a lead in the first game with our legendary ace going we‚Äôd win four of the next six from a team that had at that point beaten us 12/13. But it happened. As for this team, I like our trendlines. Five in a row. Eight of ten. Starters healthy and looking sharp. Bullpen buoyed up by guys joining like Sheehan, Kersh, Roki. There are some worries. Mookie‚Äôs still not his old self. Will is unlikely to play (catcher with a fractured hand? no way). But no team is 100%.

reddit_post,Dodgers,SeaPeanut7_,"Thoughts on the bullpen - it might not be so bad It's pretty much universally agreed upon that the bullpen is going to be a major weakness after seeing the 8th inning in both games against the reds. But I think we need to keep a few things in mind - first is that these were low leverage situations, the dodgers were up by 8 and 6 runs both times when the bullpen came in. This allowed some experimentation with pitchers like Sheehan coming in. In high leverage situations, the Dodgers bullpen can look much different. Only 3 starters are really going to be needed for the Phillies, and there is a break after both Game 1 and 4, meaning Ohtani could start both, along with Snell and Yamamoto. This leaves Glasnow available as a long reliever. Sheehan didn't show too well, but if he is on then he would apply too. Kershaw is available too. Sasaki was only tested for single innings but we all know he is a starter that can go the distance. Meaning we could have 5-6 innings from the starter and 2-3 from a longer reliever in pretty much every game. Supplement that with Banda, who did really well last year as a closer, plus a sprinkling of the other relievers when called for in matchups or to close, and it would be a far different bullpen from what we've seen so far. Basically, there were a lot of stops that Roberts could have pulled out but I do think that he might have been saving them for this upcoming series, especially with the comfortable lead that the offense was able to build up.",https://reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1nwjo48/thoughts_on_the_bullpen_it_might_not_be_so_bad/,2025-10-02T23:36:03+00:00,Phillies,1495

reddit_post,Dodgers,dtreezy,"Game Start Time Theories So I checked my DirecTV guide, and it looks like TBS has blocked off an MLB pregame show at 9:30 and a game at 10AM and a second game at 4:00PM. This doesn't mean everything, as I've definitely seen it change. On the AL side, FS1 weirdly only has one time slot blocked off at 5PM. Regardless of today's results, we know the hosts will be Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Time zone wise, it makes more sense to have the more ""eastern"" play earlier to capture more of an audience. This would lead me to think that the Dodgers would get the 10AM slot. However, btween the Cubs and Padres, the Cubs fan base would do the best to bolster the ratings of a matchup with Milwaukee. Phillies and Dodgers both have rabid fan bases that would mean big ratings....and throw in Ohtani starting in the mix with the little Ohtani graphic in corner of when he's coming up to bat and you think that TBS would HAVE to put them on in primetime, right?

reddit_post,Dodgers,TommyEdmanFan,"Thank you to the dodger fan who let me hitch a ride, from a non-dodger fan I don't use Reddit, and I'm about to pass out, so hopefully this is readable and makes sense. So for context, I'm not a Dodger fan, I'm a Cardinals fan, and out of impulse with a friend (Oakland fan) decided to go to game 2 of the WC to see some playoff ball (Dw, we cheered for the home team). We took public transport and on the way out, and took the Dodgers stadium express. I take the OC metrolink line, and 9:40, was the last train out. I get on one of the first few buses, but as we leave its becoming apparent that I might miss the train. A guy behind me also remarks how he might miss his train and how his phone is dead. I pretty quickly figure it out him and I are taking the same train, and that the bus was pulling in at 9:40-9:41, and that we had to boogie. Firstly, thanks to the dodger fans that were on that bus, that made way for him and I to make a futile dash to the platform. Obviously, we don't make it, even when the train's actual departure was 9:42pm, just as I go up the stairs of platform 16B, I see the tailights on the train pulling away. We're cooked. For me, only way back is a 2 hour long ride on the A line and the C line, for him, is even worse as he needs to get even further than I do. I learn his name, but for the sake of his privacy, I will call him C. I let him borrow my phone, to make a phone call, to which he asks if I wanted to hitch a ride with him as my destination is on the way to his. His dad (god bless him), lives in the opposite direction we are headed who C went to the game with, says he's willing to give me a ride as well. Despite years of parenting and schooling telling me NOT to get on a car with some random stranger I just met, tired me with an 8am class tomorrow just says yes. I hop in the back of their car, slightly terrified of my decision, but what happens instead is great conversation with C and his dad, and we make it to my destination, I try to give them some cash for going out of their way to get me home, but they refused. As a Cardinals fan, from the outside looking in, I had a bit of a preconceived notion that a lot of dodger fans are bandwagons, obnoxious and classless (I also went to last year's beer throwing game in the NLDS) but genuinely, seeing the dodger fans make way for us on the bus, and C and his father giving me a ride really changed my worldview, and honestly, I was really wrong about dodger fans, you guys are awesome. My experience at the game today was great, and the kindness I saw from the people I interacted with really made my week.

He is currently calculated to have been worth[ 5.0 fWAR](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/yoshinobu-yamamoto/33825/stats?position=P) and [4.9 bWAR](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/y/yamamyo01.shtml) and [42 Statcast Pitching Run Value](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/yoshinobu-yamamoto-808967?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) (the exact same as Skenes) He pitched 173.2 innings, just outside the top 10 in NL. He leads all MLB in fewest hits given up per 9 IP with 5.86. If he could have cut the walks to his 2024 BB% he could have had an even more dominant season! 201 strikeouts, 6th in NL 3rd among NL pitchers in adjusted ERA+ and Win Probability Added 7th among MLB pitchers in fWAR. He cost only $27 million against the luxury tax this year, and he is guaranteed to be a Dodger at least 4 more seasons when he has his 2030 player opt out. If he keeps pitching like this, almost certain he will take it. He turned 27 a month ago, so no reason to feel anything but super excited for the coming seasons Unfortunately, he entered the NL at the same time as the best pitcher of this era, Paul Skenes, so it will always be difficult for him to win a Cy Young. He needs another season with a few more IP, 20+ wins, and maybe a no hitter plus some Skenes voter fatigue. In a season of bad injury luck with our starters and an incredibly disappointing bullpen, its scary to think what might have been without Yoshi grinding every 6th or 7th day! He had a few bad starts, the one vs the Brewers and one vs the Angels come to mind, but overall he was so important to the team this year.

reddit_comment,Dodgers,huggsypenguinpal,"This year, the WC round was actually beneficial for the Dodgers bullpen. I think Dave & FO waited way too long, into late Sept, to retool the bullpen, and I thought they were going into the postseason with too little info. In these two lopsided games, they were able to test the young arms of Sheehan, Sasaki, Dreyer and Henriquez, and bring in Vesia and Treinen for some sharpening. In the chat last night I also mentioned that I wonder if one of the reasons the whole bullpen is infected by bad juju is because there's no leader of the BP to stop it. Last year the leader was Hudson (per Treinen during the celebration event at dodger stadium), but this year, I'm not sure who it is. It's not Tanner nor Yates, and maybe not Treinen nor Vesia.

reddit_post,Dodgers,InvestigatorNo4189,"The many positives from Treinen's outing last night We all know his recent struggles the past couple months, no need to rehash it. But here are the positive takeaways I saw from last night. 1. Velocity was good. Sinker and 4 seam in the 96 to 97 range. That's what we expect from him. It had been a tick down post injury. 2. Started off 2-0, but then came back to get the backwards K on the leadoff batter, McClain. Too many times Blake has come in, didn't have command, and couldn't adjust mid outing. Last night he overthrew his first pitch sweeper, by a lot, but after that his stuff looked very dialed in. 3. He did well against the lefties he saw, TJ Friedl and Lux. Lefties had been hitting him hard. But he struck out Friedl, and Lux didn't have hard contact (and maybe a less amped up Dean doesn't over-dive and catches that bloop.) Was this a low leverage situation? Of course. Are the Reds a poor offensive team? Of course. But Blake knows he's under pressure, and another garbage outing from him would continue to eat up the good will he's earned over the past few seasons. Is this post also heavily infused with hopium?

I feel that adjustments will be made like Tanner Scott not closing games, He didn't earn that spot. It will be a group effort like last season and only our best will close games.

reddit_comment,Dodgers,SimpleAmusings,"Angels had Shohei for 6 seasons. .. SIX!!!! prior to Shohei signing with the dodgers. Granted, Shohei was injured 1/2 the time but in 2021, 2022 and 2023, Shohei was breaking ALL kinds of records and was the american league's MVP in 21, runner up in 22, and MVP again in 23. I remember Arte, even pleading with other owners not to take Shohei when shohei first became a free agent in 2022/23. Arte thought he was milking the most out of shohei and his star power. He thought HE knew so much, he didn't even bother to re-sign him when Shohei gave the Angels first dibs to re-sign him when the other offers from\* the dodgers, jays , cubs (and maybe the giants? there were multiple teams he pitched the deferment idea to and Angels was the first to be offered) came to the table. Every \*team agreed to pay the 700 million with 680 million deferred, .....except Arte. NONE of this happens if ARTE had one more brain cell to add to his existing ONE brain cell to re-sign Shohei. Contrary to popular belief in r/baseball, the dodgers weren't a lock for shohei. Shohei LOVED THE ANGELS - he had loyalty and wanted to stay on the team and wanted to win with the angels - and EVEN if Arte didn't agree to shohei's terms of putting together a winning team, IMHO, i think shohei still would've chosen the angels if Arte matched the offer. ..but Arte didn't.. Arte said he didn't like the deferment idea (which is CRAZY), so he didn't even bother matching the offer and said shohei was a ""good top 10 player in baseball and removed Shohei from the roster and even took down shohei's mural/poster down from angel stadium the day he signed with the dodgers. the Angels organization had NO CLUE what they were sitting on or how big Shohei is ( they thought shohei selling the most baseball jersey for 2 years was the apex of his popularity), how to make him better, ( some people still think the leg kick shohei got rid of in his batting stance while he was playing with the angels was due to the angel's batting coaches instructing him - NO. Turns out Shohei observed Albert Pujol's batting stance for 2 weeks, asked him questions about it and HE himself PRACTICED it, w/o any input from the angel's training department), they over worked him tirelessly ( or they let him overwork himself with ZERO guidance) and that lead to his 2nd tommy johns. When i saw how the dodger's training team and how they handled shohei's recovery, i couldn't believe how professional the dodgers were - how so different the organization approached their player's well being; also being in a big market team that consistently goes to the playoffs , and winning his first WS last year catapulted his international popularity to heights Arte's feeble mind could never imagine. Thank the baseball GODS and all that is holy that Shohei chose the Dodgers. - i even doubt the cubs , the giants, or the blue jays could've capitalize on his greatness.",https://reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1nwcvyw/dodgers_ceo_stan_kasten_shohei_ohtanis_global/nhfumyy/,2025-10-02T21:47:14+00:00,Dodgers,2911

reddit_post,Dodgers,InvestigatorNo4189,"WC series was nearly perfect Of course you always want the bye, a best of 3 is very risky, but the Dodgers are in an incredible position heading into the DS 1. Players that needed rest, Will Smith, Edman and his ankle, were able to get it. 2. The sluggers were able to stay sharp by facing real mlb pitching, and not lose their timing with a week off of baseball. In past years, Mookie had implied that the time off during the bye disrupted his timing at the plate. How good does he look now? 3. The starting rotation is still well positioned. Maybe you don‚Äôt get to line up your rotation perfectly for the DS, but we didn‚Äôt have to use Ohtani for a potential game 3, and now he‚Äôs set for game 1 with either Glas or Snell available for game 2. 4. The bullpen is the biggest question mark for this team, and we got some valuable information about who has it, and who may not have it.

reddit_comment,Dodgers,Dihydrogenmonoxide-_,"Phillies fan popping in. Didn't want to make a post, but I was at the game on the 15th where the Phils won in extras. First time at Dodger stadium, I thought the place was awesome. Getting in and out was super easy as a first timer, fans were cool as shit, no one gave us any problems. Almost got hit by Ohtani's laser foul ball early in the game. My wife really liked the garlic fries. It was a great time. Definitely my favorite away game experience to date. üëå https://preview.redd.it/xb4ns2rseirf1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b409fec67c1527ae189c766e2d312cd43a58a07c",https://reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1nqzgio/daily_chat_926_game_day/ngava2f/,2025-09-26T13:16:59+00:00,LAD,581
reddit_comment,Dodgers,webelee,"3 games left, people might think they are meaningless as we clinched. But things I want to see. 1. One more win to win the division outright. 2. Strong play against a possible WS matchup team if both get there. 3. At least 1 more Ohtani homerun so he sets a new single season Dodger record. 4. A few more doubles from Freeman so he goes up the all-time doubles board. 5. Trying out rookies, bench, and bullpen to see how they all look. 6. Strong final 1 last win for Kershaw. 7.

The two recent Dodger games where Sasaki came in out of the bullpen and by the official MLB ‚Äúhold‚Äù definition shouldn't he have been awarded a hold in each of those two relief outings - i.e. 2 holds total? Game 1 - Dodgers at Diamondbacks, Sept 24, 2025 - Sasaki entered in the 7th inning with the Dodgers leading 3‚Äì2, threw a 1-2-3 inning (a scoreless inning with outs recorded) and left with the lead intact. - Entered with a lead of 3 runs or fewer (tying run either on deck/at bat/on base), recorded outs, left without surrendering the lead ~ qualifies for a hold. Game 2 - Dodgers at Mariners, Sept 26, 2025 - Sasaki again worked a scoreless inning in relief, protecting a two-run lead (the team was ahead by two when he entered) and recorded outs without giving up the lead. - Same as above - entered in a save situation, recorded at least one out, left with the lead intact - qualifies for a hold.

reddit_post,Dodgers,Wonderful_Rest3124,"Dodger Blue Dream Wanted to share with other Dodgers fans that a Dodgers podcast (second season) started today. The reason I‚Äôm sharing this podcast is because this is the podcast that got me into baseball. I had watched a grand total of 6 game in my life maybe. I‚Äôm a native California and had never been to a dodgers ball game. Only ever attended a Rockies game and Mariners game. After listening to the first season post the 2024 World Series run I fell in deep. Listened to every bit of it and was inexplicably hyped for baseball. I‚Äôve now watched over a hundred games this year easily and attended two dodgers games in person. I fucking love baseball and this podcast is a special one for me at least. The stories of the team is what caught me off guard and pulled me in. Check it out if you want something a little different.

reddit_post,Dodgers,queerbirdgirl,"The 8th inning bullpen blowup...might have been a good thing. It's relatively rare to get such a low-leverage situation going in the postseason, and leading 10-2 is about as low-leverage as things can get. Doc fully made a mistake going to Vesia after making him get warm in the 7th as well - Vesia gets thrown off easily by little changes to his routine; that much we know by now. But throwing Henriquez in was a great opportunity to test his mettle for the rest of the postseason, as was getting dryer to scrub in to prove he can still throw strikes. I honestly think some of these guys are much better used in high leverage, and while the white-knuckler in me would have preferred if Doc had just sent in Sheehan for 2 innings to get 6 outs and maybe give up a run or two, I think the team earned some really valuable information about who to send out when and what not to do going forward. Should they have learned this all in the season? Yes, but the playoffs are a different beast entirely.",https://reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1nuz0rp/the_8th_inning_bullpen_blowupmight_have_been_a/,2025-10-01T04:38:38+00:00,A's,996

reddit_comment,Dodgers,Koronesukiii,"Now I'm no expert, but swap Henriquez and Vesia around and I don't think we blow up. &nbsp; Bring Henriquez on for clean innings where he's not worried about runners and feels safe attacking the zone. Same thing with Scott. These are guys that don't trust their own command and need a mental cushion where they are allowed to make one mistake, put one runner on. &nbsp; Give Vesia dirty innings where minimizing damage is a job well done. Put him in high pressure situations where the mission is straightforward and the only thing he needs to think about is executing each pitch. Same thing with BlaQ. These are guys that absolutely can dial in. It's a matter of knowing the situation is bad enough the result is secondary to execution. Get the pitch where it's asked.

reddit_post,Dodgers,webelee,"Blessed as an LA fan The past few weeks, from the day that Kershaw announced his retirement, I have begun to realize how blessed we are to be LA sports fans. Maybe even taking some of it for granted, or at the very least, forgetting the joys that we have had. I don't want to go too back in nostalgia, and can't cover all sports, but we know the 2 dominant LA teams are the Dodgers and the Lakers. Both are historic winning franchises. And look what we were able to enjoy since the mid/late 90s. We had Kobe on the Lakers. 20 years of giving his all, through blood, sweat, tears and sacrifice. Lifelong Laker and remembered as possibly the greatest Laker of all time (as even Magic says). 5 championships during his career. We had Kershaw on the Dodger. 18 years of giving his all, through blood, sweat, tears and sacrifice. Lifelong Dodger and may go down as possibly the greatest Dodger of all time. 2 championships during his career. After Kobe, we got Lebron?!?! Who brought us another championship. And now Luka!!! After Kershaw, or as he got older, we got Betts and Freeman. And also Ohtani! Like, seeing the various fanbases who do not get a sniff of championships, and even other major cities not going all the way compared to these two teams, we are truly blessed. And I don't want to take it for granted anymore. Kobe, Kershaw... now Lebron and Luka, and Betts, Freeman, and Ohtani. How wonderful it is to have been a lifelong Dodgers and Lakers fan. How wonderful that I get to share these teams with my children as well. Kids love these team.

reddit_post,Dodgers,MookieBettsBurner4,"Serious question: what are some moves you guys want to see the Dodgers make these next two off-seasons? I'm nervous about the day before the playoffs, so I wanna talk about plans to kill the time. To be honest, these next two years' free agency classes uh....leave much to be desired. They are not nearly as good as the classes of previous years, as many of the would-be free agents have been locked down via extensions like Vlad Jr. Kyle Tucker, Steven Kwan, Tarik Skubal and maybe Michael King are really the only guys that I see could fit on this team that we have a realistic shot at acquiring that could move the needle. (Bregman would be good too, but I don't need to talk about why there's no way in hell he ever comes here, plus we already have Muncy). Even for the last two, we have a lot of pitching depth as it is, we just struggle to keep them healthy. That's not to say that there aren't good pieces out there, but unlike previous years' classes, there is no Ohtani, no Judge, no Soto, no clear-cut 40 million AAV player out there (maybe Kyle Tucker, but I don't put him in the same category as the other 3). Honestly, I'd rather we just call up our young guys, I'm pretty high on Hope and De Paula. If there was ever a time to take a break from spending, this year (except for Tucker) and next year would be it I feel. Also, this is going to sound like a hot take, but....I would honestly like to see the team clean house on our coaching staff. That is the big off-season move I'd like to see. I'm sorry, but given all of our struggles with pitcher injuries and underperformance, and the offense underperformance for a good chunk of the season, I feel like Prior and RVS have lost their magic. Dave isn't the problem, but given three years of killing our pitchers, I feel like we need a change in direction. A lot of our players have also strayed from our philosophy of plate discipline too, this team is full of guys like Teo, Edman, and Pages who chase pitches, don't work counts, and most importantly don't draw walks.",https://reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1ntchxb/serious_question_what_are_some_moves_you_guys/,2025-09-29T08:20:59+00:00,A's,2035

reddit_comment,Dodgers,webelee,"When thinking about this, we can't just look at FA we want to bring in, but which of our players have contracts expiring. 2025 Conforto comes off the books, I don't think we resign him. Kirby Yates, don't think we resign him unless it is for a lot less. Miguel Rojas, this is where it gets interesting. Maybe cheaper deal, but also depends on how we want to use Kim, Edman moving forward. So we will need at least RP, we probably would want a change even if not for Yates. Then we need an OF. So Kwan is possible. 2026 Kopech contract ends, so if he doesn't light it up that season, who knows? Muncy contract ends, and if he does not retire, I don't really see us seeing him walk. So depending on production, or retirement, maybe a 1-2 year deal. Vesia is a club option, I think we may pick it up. 2027 This is the big year!!! Glasnow, Freeman have contracts ending. Not sure how Glasnow will look moving forward, but Freeman may be close to retiring after that season. My hope is to resign Freeman and have his last few seasons in Dodger blue. If he someday signs a one day contract with the Braves and retires a Brave that is on him to do and definitely he deserves that right. But depending on how he is looking I would also want a 2-3 year deal and keep him at 1st. Betts has a player option, so if he opts out we need to try and resign, hopefully restructure so we can sign other players as well. He is under contract until 2032, but if he opts out, we need to redo the contract. All this to say, with any sport, we sign according to need and how our young players are developing.

reddit_comment,Dodgers,dogvenom,"I think we kick the tires on potential reunion with Bellinger, despite the obvious potential negatives (Boras being a nightmare to deal with, fear that Belli will regress, no short right field porch in Dodger Stadium). Yankees organization appears to value him very much though. He has somehow transformed himself into a guy that is hard to strike out. Even if he isn't hitting, he's still a versatile fielder and plus base runner. A natural and smooth at several positions, we could plug him right into CF again and either #5 or #6 in our lineup.

reddit_comment,Dodgers,Primary_Sundae_1299,"From a position player standpoint we MUST upgrade a corner outfield spot. Tucker could be a good fit. Kwan would be great that‚Äôs why we talked with the guardians this year about him. But the conforto experiment failed and must be jettisoned. I‚Äôd love to see kwan in right and move teo to left and I like pages in center. If we stand pat I still don‚Äôt understand why we don‚Äôt put edman in center as he‚Äôs the best defensive player for the outfield. Move pages to right and teo to left and we‚Äôve got a damn good outfield. I also think we should at least strongly consider an upgrade over muncy at third. I love max and he‚Äôs been a great dodger but to me he‚Äôs clearly on the down swing. His average is perennially poor and his obp is slipping as well. He‚Äôs striking out quite a bit and he‚Äôs an average at best defender. He still has power but to me it‚Äôs time to upgrade. That‚Äôs why I was hoping we would get arrenado this year. Can‚Äôt sign off on bregman. I think the hatred among dodger nation for that cheater is too strong. I know it is for me. And then they need to finalize second base. Is Kim the man or not? I like Kim a lot and what he brings to the table. I am mystified why Roberts bent over backward all year to play conforto despite being literally the worst hitter in baseball for most of that time! Yet he seems reluctant to play Kim who is a far better hitter, far better defender and has tremendous speed. Don‚Äôt get that one. But they need to figure it out. This is assuming edman moves to the outfield. If he doesn‚Äôt then clearly he‚Äôs the best option at second if he can stay healthy. Otherwise I think we‚Äôre good at all other positions. Pitching wise assuming we can get healthy and get all the guys we lost this year back like gonsolin, hurt, Ryan, stone, grove, etc. We should be loaded with starters even with the great Kershaw retiring.

reddit_post,SFGiants,Jrahn,"Baseball America - Top 35 DSL prospects for 2025 1. Josuar Gonzalez, SS, Giants Gonzalez was one of the top talents available during this year‚Äôs international signing period, and he quickly lived up to the billing. The 17-year-old drew raves for his slick fielding, which will make him a surefire bet to stick at shortstop and provide defense that could reach double-plus at his peak. Gonzalez also earned potential 70 grades for his speed, which helped him swipe 33 bags in 38 tries. Gonzalez was a bit streaky at the plate in his pro debut, but at his best, he showed a sound knowledge of the strike zone and the elements of a turn-and-burn player who makes his money at the top of a lineup. The switch-hitter‚Äôs righthanded swing is handsier and more contact-oriented, while his lefthanded cut is geared for more impact. 14. Carlos De La Rosa, LHP, Giants De La Rosa made waves early in the season and raised enough eyebrows to become part of the four-player package the Yankees sent to San Francisco to acquire reliever Camilo Doval. He is a smaller lefthander, but he possesses a big-time arsenal. De La Rosa already brings his fastball up to 97 mph and backs it with a full complement of offspeed pitches that lend credence to the idea that he can remain a starter as he moves through the minors. He‚Äôll also have to work to maintain consistency in his delivery after multiple evaluators noted that he dropped his slot and slowed his arm on his slider. In a vacuum, the pitch has above-average potential. His changeup could be an average pitch, as well, giving him the upside of a No. 4 starter.",https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1nweks9/baseball_america_top_35_dsl_prospects_for_2025/,2025-10-02T20:11:54+00:00,Yankees,1599

I think the infield of Devers, Schmitt, Adames, and Chapman is elite. I‚Äôd like to give Schmitt another year, and make a trade deadline deal for a 2B if he regresses. Or maybe Fitzgerald or Koss show something. We need to let our young outfielders play, so alongside Lee going into spring training we have Gilbert, Ramos, McCray, Encarnacion, Matos, and yes, even Marco Luciano. We need to see who is for real and who needs to get waived/traded/or let walk. We can‚Äôt purely buy a ring, it needs to be a combo of home grown and obtained talent.

reddit_comment,SFGiants,GentlemanDownstairs,"I can‚Äôt claim to be the biggest baseball fan, but I don‚Äôt know how a manager search should look. My only point of reference is the NFL, which usually has a recycling cast of HCs plus some hot names that were OCs, occasionally DCs. Usually those units over performed relative to talent, hence young guys with new ideas. Football isn‚Äôt static and evolves yearly. For example, the rule changes give the offense an incentive to pass more/score more, so there are is a premium on CBs and pass rushers in addition to QBs and WRs (and OTs). Gone are the FB lead blockers and 240 lbs RBs. It‚Äôs all spread, 3 WR sets‚Äî‚Äú11 personal.‚Äù Then the defenses cope by getting faster and smaller‚Äîhybrid Safety/LBs, small LBs that are 225lbs and run a 4.5 40. Then it swings the other way‚Äîsome offenses (SD) go large and road grader to counter to smaller/faster Ds, cat and mouse. I don‚Äôt understand how baseball coaches could really have that many new ideas in a relatively static sport. Sure, they have pitch timers now and bigger bases‚Äîminor changes. We had ‚Äúthe shift‚Äù and all that. But what does a new idea look like from a sport that essentially unchanged for 149 years? Not dragging it‚Äîthat‚Äôs part of its appeal. It‚Äôs timeless. I do think SF needs a younger coach with new ideas and all that, I just don‚Äôt know what that looks like. Are there examples? Bochy won a WS in ‚Äò23 and Baker in ‚Äò22‚Ä¶.so old dudes can guide to wins. I‚Äôm not advocating for a retread‚ÄîI want that new, young fresh perspective.

reddit_post,SFGiants,CampSubject9176,"Giants end of season letter Oct 1, 2025 Dear Giants Fans, Over the 25 years since Oracle Park opened its gates, it has become so much more than a ballpark. It is a pillar of community, a center of activity, and a place where memories are made. And through it all - the highs and lows - you have been there. You‚Äôve never relented. Our loyal, passionate, and dedicated fans. You are the heart of 24 Willie Mays Plaza and we can‚Äôt do this without you. Thanks to you, attendance this season surged to numbers we haven‚Äôt seen in almost a decade, selling out 28 games. Your energy was electric and contagious. Your energy was maybe only matched by that of Willy Adames, who said it best when he accepted the 2025 Willie Mac Award, ‚ÄúI want to thank the best fans in the world. For your passion, your support - it never goes unnoticed. You guys bring the energy every single day. And I'm proud to wear this uniform.‚Äù This season saw its fair share of ups and downs. Like us, you relished in the highs: We signed Willy, sat near the top of the NL West for a majority of the season, traded for three-time All-Star Rafael Devers, and were in the playoff race until the last week of the season. But then there were the stalls: Injuries, inconsistent stretches, and missed opportunities. We all share in your frustration. We don‚Äôt do this for mediocrity. We own the results and the responsibility to do better. As Matt Chapman spoke on behalf of the team after Sunday‚Äôs game, he said, ‚ÄúWe love you guys. You guys support us every single night. It means a lot. You guys spend your money to show up and support us - you cheer hard. We didn‚Äôt reach our goal this year - we‚Äôre all disappointed. We‚Äôre going home and we‚Äôre going to get better.‚Äù Amidst the highs, we saw what this team is capable of. Logan Webb, an All-Star for the second straight year, led the National League in innings pitched and strikeouts. Robbie Ray was an All-Star and threw 180+ innings in his first full season back from being injured. Willy hit 30 home runs, becoming the first Giant since Barry Bonds in 2004 to reach 30 in a season. Chappy, once again, showed off his impressive defensive skills and once Raffy settled in, we witnessed why he‚Äôs one of the top hitters in baseball. Patrick Bailey will likely win his second-consecutive Gold Glove and his inside the park walk off home run in July was electrifying. Heliot Ramos continued to be a vital part of the lineup, posting another 20+ homer season and leading the team in hits (159). Jung Hoo Lee played in a professional career high 150 games and over the last two months batted .306. When this core returns for a full season together in ‚Äò26, there is potential for greatness. As we look forward, our focus remains clear - to build a roster that plays a tough, connected brand of baseball. We are committed to finding a manager who will lead a winning team that is gritty, relentless in their preparation, and hungry for excellence. Thank you for believing in us, trusting us, and holding us to a high standard. We are excited to get to work and look forward to reuniting with you at Oracle Park for the 2026 season. With gratitude, Larry Baer President & Chief Executive Officer San Francisco Giants Buster Posey President of Baseball Operations San Francisco Giants",https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1nvldn8/giants_end_of_season_letter/,2025-10-01T21:38:23+00:00,Giants,3286

reddit_comment,SFGiants,Indubitalist,"Interesting that they listed Ramos as part of the core. That to me says he‚Äôs definitely on the team in 2026 (rather than traded for pitching or something) and that almost certainly means we‚Äôll start the season with the same left fielder we had this year. That will be the first time we‚Äôve had consecutive seasons starting with the same left fielder since Barry left after 2007. That‚Äôs got to make Ramos feel good. Of course, if the Giants wanted to start somebody else in that spot just to mess with people they could, which would set a record for the most consecutive seasons a team had fielded a different player in the same position year after year (20 seasons). They currently hold a tie with the 1937-1955 St. Louis Browns/Baltimore Orioles, who also had a revolving door in left field.",https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1nvldn8/giants_end_of_season_letter/nhbvm7k/,2025-10-02T08:02:20+00:00,Giants,791

Would they consider someone from their own affiliates like Brundage (maybe not the best example but he‚Äôd know the players, right?) or other triple-a teams?

reddit_post,SFGiants,TechnicalLeave6989,"The Golden Era of the San Francisco Giants San Francisco did not win with flash. The city fell in love with a team that pitched fearless, defended every inch, and found loud swings in quiet moments. That is what made the Giants different. One October at a time they made pressure feel like home. Tim Lincecum spun hitters into knots. Matt Cain pounded the zone. Madison Bumgarner carried a calm that could silence any crowd. Buster Posey framed the whole thing with a steady glove and a steady heart. Around them lived role players like Juan Uribe, Cody Ross, Marco Scutaro, Pablo Sandoval and Hunter Pence who refused to act small. Nobody needed the spotlight. They only needed one more out. That is how a run becomes a memory and how a memory becomes a golden era. A Youtube video shed light on the iconic era of the Giants where dreams became a possibility.

reddit_comment,SFGiants,Depot-Donny-Don,Yes Adames got 30 and good for him and yes the streak is over. But I do agree it should be broken by a few HR's not just 1 and on the last day of the season where it's served up on a platter. A fastball night down the middle for him to go get it. And yes he crushed it where some others batters couldn't have done it. So I do believe with Devers in a full season staying away from the injury bug and yes Adames also barring injury will both get 30 HR's and more and hopefully as Giants fans we will get to see that for years to come,https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1ntsdl3/some_of_my_friends_are_weirdly_sad_the_30_hr/nh585z1/,2025-10-01T06:42:53+00:00,Giants,532

reddit_comment,SFGiants,might_southern,"Had to happen. Melvin might be popular with the players but there's no denying that the teams he manages consistently underperform. When you see guys constantly make mental errors in the field, fall apart in critical situations, and look lost at the plate, there's nowhere to place the blame but on your coaches. Also, his penchant for leaving pitchers out to dry when it was clear they were either losing steam or just didn't have it that day lost us multiple games throughout the season, and directly led to Randy Rodriguez blowing out his arm from being overworked. Given the talent on this roster and the commitment from the front office to improve the team during the offseason, getting a new coaching staff in here will be the best possible salve for a disappointing season.",https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1ntmubi/bob_melvin_dismissed_as_san_francisco_giants/nguv24b/,2025-09-29T16:59:01+00:00,Giants,780

reddit_comment,SFGiants,SuspiciousCat4446,"I think simply having the continuity of an actual core of guys with important situational pieces around them is what is going to help elevate this team. We didn‚Äôt have that chemistry coming into this season because so many guys were new to the team. Now that guys like Lee, Devers, Adames, Ramos, chapman et al are sticking around in the rotation, and hopefully we get consistent production and playing time out of other utility players, I think focusing on pitching is the big one. I truly believe we have the bats and the next two seasons will see more consistency and confidence from them.

reddit_comment,SFGiants,LugiaPizza,"Listening to the postgame coverage was odd. They talked about how they had 4 men hit 20+ for the first time in ages and right after they talked bout how they had pieces for 2026 and beyond. They mentioned Devers, Adames and Chapman, but make no mention of Ramos who they had just talked about. They also brought up how Buster had to get to work and acquire missing pieces via trade or free agency. Free Agency doesn't start till a week after the WS, but I get where they were going. It's not just adding another starter and couple bullpen arms. They're going to have to make moves that shake things up. Don't see Jung Hoo Lee being moved, but maybe Ramos? Kuiper's brother, right before the trade deadline, thought Ramos was on the move and now Bonta and Rich kinda make you think the same.",https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1nt6dsu/prediction/ngrhqjx/,2025-09-29T02:39:27+00:00,Giants,790

reddit_post,SFGiants,guinnessdrinker85,Verlander How we feeling about this man? Seemed like he had a bit of the opposite season from the rest of the team. When things were going well early on Verlander struggled but he seemed to be solid in the second half when everything else for the Giants was falling apart. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to another year as it‚Äôll probably be another 1 year deal at about the same money or maybe a little less. Webb and Ray locked in for the two spots (maybe Roupp for a third spot). Need to fill in the rest and none of the Giants AAAA really showed enough to guarantee a spot.,https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1nt5r4j/verlander/,2025-09-29T01:45:38+00:00,Giants,578

reddit_post,SFGiants,ericthelostman,"2026 MLB Draft prospects with Norcal/Bay Area ties The Giants currently sit 15th in MLB Draft lottery odds and December's lottery will determine their official spot. It's very notable that several potential 1st round prospects are from/have ties to Northern California or the Bay Area. The Giants don't necessarily draft based on geography, but it's an added bonus to have great prospects tied to your area. Tyler Spangler, SS, De La Salle HS (Concord, CA) 6'3 195 pounds. Spangler may be the most talented Bay Area prep in a long time and may be a top 5/10 pick. He's shown well on the showcase circuit. He's repped by Boras and committed to Stanford so his bonus ask will be high. Ryder Helfrick, C, University of Arkansas. Helfrick was born in Livermore and attended Clayton Valley Charter HS in Concord, CA. Helfrick was a major standout in the Razorbacks run to the CWS this past season. Continued improvement could land him in the first round and the Giants could definitely use catching depth in the organization. Jackson Flora, RHP, UC Santa Barbara. The 6'5 205 pound righty was born in Walnut Creek and went to Foothill HS in Pleasanton. Throws mid-upper 90's heat and goes to a school with a great reputation for pitching development. The Giants could definitely use high end pitching talent in the organization. Roch Cholowsky, SS, UCLA was born in Vallejo, but grew up in Arizona. He could be the #1 overall pick with a strong spring so G's will have zero shot at him. Gabe Gaeckle, RHP, Arkansas isn't from Norcal (Aptos, CA in Santa Cruz County), but he is worth paying attention to. He served as closer this past season, but will get a chance to prove he can hold up as a starter in Spring. SEC schools have been fattening up on California talent (both southern/northern) in all major sports for awhile now.",https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1nt5op2/2026_mlb_draft_prospects_with_norcalbay_area_ties/,2025-09-29T01:42:21+00:00,Giants,1823

I don't know a whole lot about any of these guys other than prospect video, but some names I've seen... Jackson Flora is a California guy. I would not be upset if they landed him in the 1st round. Logan Schmidt is another and he throws heat.

reddit_comment,SFGiants,Shark_Jaws,"POTG: Willy for breaking the 30 HR drought so we can finally forget that stat. So fitting it came down to game 162. As this season comes to a close, looking back on those bad stretches that ended up burying us, it was easy to say ""offense bad,"" but what hasn't been talked about enough is just how bad it actually was statistically. As you can see in these rankings just before today's game 162, the Giants were in the bottom half of the league in every offensive category. Runs Per Game: 4.35 17th Home Runs: 171 19th On Base Percentage: .311 20th Batting Average: .235 24th Slugging Percentage: .386 25th Hits Per Game: 7.79 26th Stolen Bases: 68 29th Despite this, we were still able to finish .500. Just think about the potential if we can even move a couple of those rankings out of the 20s by making the right moves in the off-season. The main priority other than focusing on putting the ball in play rather than taking the Pat Burrell approach at the plate has to be the basepaths. 29th in stolen bases is inexcusable. Think about how much rallies for us died by the strikeout and not being able to swipe that extra bag. Buster has his work cut out for him, but I have faith that he will be able to get the team back to the playoffs. It was a frustrating year, but we're not as far off from contending again as many people would like to think. Most of the guys that are going to get us back there are on the roster already. I expect we will take a step forward towards that in 2026.

reddit_post,SFGiants,Ego_Splendonius,"If every SF Giants team who made the playoffs/WS played each other in a round robin tournament of 4 best of 7 series, who would win? With the Giants sitting out the postseason again, I thought that it would be fun to do a thought experiment; if all 13 San Francisco Giants teams which made the postseason were pitted against each other in a round-robin tournament, who would win? The format is 4 7-game series and 1 2-3 wild card series to trim the 13 teams down to and even 12. Seeding is determined by record, and tie-breakers are determined by better home record as record against division opponents can't be used due to historical expansion/division play changes. The rules of each game must follow that of MLB in the historical era of the home team (e.g., no replay review and homeplate blocking allowed except for games hosted by the 2014, 2016 and 2021 teams); see MLB [rule changes](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/rulechng.shtml) since 1962. Each team's lineup will be that which they had at the start of the postseason. Historical accuracy feedback is welcome for the starting pitching matchups, e.g. for 1997 which was swept, I only assumed that Mark Gardner would be the planned Game 4 NLDS starter, correct me if wrong. **The seeding:** 1. 2021 (107-55) 2. 1962 (103-62) 3. 2003 (100-61) 4. 2000 (97-65) 5. 2002 (95-66) 6. 2012 (94-68) 7. 1989 (92-70) 8. 2010 (92-70) 9. 1971 (90-72) 10. 1997 (90-72) 11. 1987 (90-72) 12. 2014 (88-74) 13. 2016 (87-75) **Match-ups:** First, the bottom 2 teams will square off in a 2-3 wild card series: **‚Ä¢ Wild Card (2-3):** **#12 2014 vs. #13 2016** \-managers: Bruce Bochy (2014); Bruce Bochy (2016) Game 1 starters: Madison Bumgarner (2014) vs. Madison Bumgarner (2016) Game 2 starters: Tim Hudson vs. Johnny Cueto Game 3 starters: Jake Peavy vs. Jeff Samardzija The match-ups for the 1st round of 7 game series. **‚Ä¢ #1 2021 vs. #12/13** \-managers: Gabe Kapler; Bruce Bochy (2014)/(2016) Game 1 starters: Logan Webb vs. TBA Game 2 starters: Kevin Gausmann vs. TBA Game 3 starters: Alex Wood vs. TBA Game 4 starters: Anthony Desclefani vs. TBA **‚Ä¢ #2 1962 vs. #11 1987** \-managers: Alvin Dark; Roger Craig Game 1 starters: Billy O‚ÄôDell vs. Rick Reuschel Game 2 starters: Jack Sanford vs. Dave Dravecky Game 3 starters: Billy Pierce vs. Atlee Hammaker Game 4 starters: Billy O‚ÄôDell vs. Mike Krukow **‚Ä¢ #3 2003 vs. #10 1997** \-managers: Felipe Alou; Dusty Baker Game 1 starters: Jason Schimdt vs. Kirk Rueter (1997) Game 2 starters: Sidney Ponson vs. Shawn Estes Game 3 starters: Kirk Rueter (2003) vs. Wilson √Ålvarez Game 4 starters: Jerome Williams vs. Mark Gardner **‚Ä¢ #4 2000 vs. #9 1971** \-managers: Dusty Baker; Charlie Fox Game 1 starters: Liv√°n Hernandez vs. Gaylord Perry Game 2 starters: Shawn Estes vs. John Cumberland Game 3 starters: Russ Ortiz vs. Juan Marichal Game 4 starters: Mark Gardner vs. Gaylord Perry **‚Ä¢ #5 2002 vs. #8 2010** \-managers: Dusty Baker; Bruce Bochy Game 1 starters: Russ Ortiz vs. Tim Lincecum Game 2 starters: Kirk Rueter vs. Matt Cain Game 3 starters: Jason Schmidt vs. Jonathan Sanchez Game 4 starters: Liv√°n Hernandez vs. Madison Bumgarner **‚Ä¢ #6 2012 vs. #7 1989** \-managers: Bruce Bochy; Roger Craig Game 1 starters: Matt Cain vs. Scott Garrelts Game 2 starters: Madison Bumgarner vs. Rick Reuschel Game 3 starters: Ryan Vogelsong vs. Mike LaCoss Game 4 starters: Barry Zito vs. Scott Garrelts Edit: crap, how did I forget that 2003 was Alou's first year as manager. On paper, 1962 would probably be the favorite. The most intriguing matchup would be 2002 vs. 2010; that series would be must-watch. Mays/McCovey vs. Bonds in 2000 vs. 1971 is also a must-watch.

reddit_post,SFGiants,dq72,"What is the purpose of a manager and coaches? As we wait to hear the fate of Bob Melvin I‚Äôve heard a lot of the arguments once again about it‚Äôs the players. And it just makes me want to understand what people think about what a manager is actually responsible for and what are the coaches responsible for if they‚Äôre not on the hook for anything and everything is all on the players then why are they there at all? If they are accountable and responsible for for something even if it‚Äôs not 100% of the burden then they have to also pay the consequences for under performance . in my opinion, the manager and coaches are responsible for change when change is warranted and that‚Äôs what we didn‚Äôt see. I again refer to this WSJ article about the Padres changing something. If these decisions are not up to the manager in conference with coaches, then what are they good for?

reddit_comment,SFGiants,sfgiants2000,"It's a tangled web. Managers and coaches do directly impact the game with decision making and the ability (or lack of) to make adjustments in-game. And that stands true for non-game situations, in regards to adjustments as well. It's also important - perhaps equally - to be a manager of personalities. Some guys need to be coddled to get the best out of them. Some need to be yelled at, some need tough love, etc, etc. Managers and coaches need to figure out who needs what to get the best performance out of them. All that said, they can't perform for the player, so their reach of impact can only stretch as far as the player allows it, generally speaking.",https://reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1ntlvwy/what_is_the_purpose_of_a_manager_and_coaches/nguq29p/,2025-09-29T16:35:14+00:00,Padres,659

reddit_comment,SFGiants,Tronn3000,"I know all the boomers and gen x'ers that call into KNBR want Bochy back but I just don't see hiring Bochy is the right move. Bochy was a fantastic manager and I'll always be grateful for him bringing this team 3 championships but he's in his 70s and probably won't be managing much longer. He's at the sunset point of his baseball career. Let him sail into that sunset. It Bochy wants to come back, Buster should hire him as a front office special advisor The Giants need a younger manager at the helm that can optimize this roster in the modern game. They need someone that can potentially be with this team for a decade if it works out. I want someone that is buying into this team for the long haul and ready to build a new culture and with that, they need someone young that wants to prove themselves. I really like Nick Hundley or Curt Casali as candidates.

They so badly want to blame the Giants for all their problems but the reality is JOHN FISHER NEVER EVER WANTED TO KEEP THE A'S IN THE BAY AREA. The market just isn't big enough for two teams at the moment and he knew that. Also the Giants came to the Bay Area first. I have zero faith in him being able to make the A's successful in Vegas considering it's a transplant city and the A's have too much of that John Fisher stink on them to make fans support them. They have an exciting team but I wouldn't be surprised if Clark, Kurtz, and Rooker all get traded in like a year or two. Anyways, welcome aboard. We are happy to have you her.

reddit_post,Padres,Bravefan212,"The Green Fields of the Mind I posted this last year, I like reading it this time of year An essay by former commissioner Bart Giamatti ""The Green Fields of the Mind "" It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. You count on it, rely on it to buffer the passage of time, to keep the memory of sunshine and high skies alive, and then just when the days are all twilight, when you need it most, it stops. Today, October 2, a Sunday of rain and broken branches and leaf-clogged drains and slick streets, it stopped, and summer was gone. Somehow, the summer seemed to slip by faster this time. Maybe it wasn't this summer, but all the summers that, in this my fortieth summer, slipped by so fast. There comes a time when every summer will have something of autumn about it. Whatever the reason, it seemed to me that I was investing more and more in baseball, making the game do more of the work that keeps time fat and slow and lazy. I was counting on the game's deep patterns, three strikes, three outs, three times three innings, and its deepest impulse, to go out and back, to leave and to return home, to set the order of the day and to organize the daylight. I wrote a few things this last summer, this summer that did not last, nothing grand but some things, and yet that work was just camouflage. The real activity was done with the radio--not the all-seeing, all-falsifying television--and was the playing of the game in the only place it will last, the enclosed green field of the mind. There, in that warm, bright place, what the old poet called Mutability does not so quickly come. But out here, on Sunday, October 2, where it rains all day, Dame Mutability never loses. She was in the crowd at Fenway yesterday, a gray day full of bluster and contradiction, when the Red Sox came up in the last of the ninth trailing Baltimore 8-5, while the Yankees, rain-delayed against Detroit, only needing to win one or have Boston lose one to win it all, sat in New York washing down cold cuts with beer and watching the Boston game. Boston had won two, the Yankees had lost two, and suddenly it seemed as if the whole season might go to the last day, or beyond, except here was Boston losing 8-5, while New York sat in its family room and put its feet up. Lynn, both ankles hurting now as they had in July, hits a single down the right-field line. The crowd stirs. It is on its feet. Hobson, third baseman, former Bear Bryant quarterback, strong, quiet, over 100 RBIs, goes for three breaking balls and is out. The goddess smiles and encourages her agent, a canny journeyman named Nelson Briles. Now comes a pinch hitter, Bernie Carbo, onetime Rookie of the Year, erratic, quick, a shade too handsome, so laid-back he is always, in his soul, stretched out in the tall grass, one arm under his head, watching the clouds and laughing; now he looks over some low stuff unworthy of him and then, uncoiling, sends one out, straight on a rising line, over the center-field wall, no cheap Fenway shot, but all of it, the physics as elegant as the arc the ball describes. New England is on its feet, roaring. The summer will not pass. Roaring, they recall the evening, late and cold, in 1975, the sixth game of the World Series, perhaps the greatest baseball game played in the last fifty years, when Carbo, loose and easy, had uncoiled to tie the game that Fisk would win. It is 8-7, one out, and school will never start, rain will never come, sun will warm the back of your neck forever. Now Bailey, picked up from the National League recently, big arms, heavy gut, experienced, new to the league and the club; he fouls off two and then, checking, tentative, a big man off balance, he pops a soft liner to the first baseman. It is suddenly darker and later, and the announcer doing the game coast to coast, a New Yorker who works for a New York television station, sounds relieved. His little world, well-lit, hot-combed, split-second-timed, had no capacity to absorb this much gritty, grainy, contrary reality. Cox swings a bat, stretches his long arms, bends his back, the rookie from Pawtucket who broke in two weeks earlier with a record six straight hits, the kid drafted ahead of Fred Lynn, rangy, smooth, cool. The count runs two and two, Briles is cagey, nothing too good, and Cox swings, the ball beginning toward the mound and then, in a jaunty, wayward dance, skipping past Briles, feinting to the right, skimming the last of the grass, finding the dirt, moving now like some small, purposeful marine creature negotiating the green deep, easily avoiding the jagged rock of second base, traveling steady and straight now out into the dark, silent recesses of center field. The aisles are jammed, the place is on its feet, the wrappers, the programs, the Coke cups and peanut shells, the doctrines of an afternoon; the anxieties, the things that have to be done tomorrow, the regrets about yesterday, the accumulation of a summer: all forgotten, while hope, the anchor, bites and takes hold where a moment before it seemed we would be swept out with the tide. Rice is up. Rice whom Aaron had said was the only one he'd seen with the ability to break his records. Rice the best clutch hitter on the club, with the best slugging percentage in the league. Rice, so quick and strong he once checked his swing halfway through and snapped the bat in two. Rice the Hammer of God sent to scourge the Yankees, the sound was overwhelming, fathers pounded their sons on the back, cars pulled off the road, households froze, New England exulted in its blessedness, and roared its thanks for all good things, for Rice and for a summer stretching halfway through October. Briles threw, Rice swung, and it was over. One pitch, a fly to center, and it stopped. Summer died in New England and like rain sliding off a roof, the crowd slipped out of Fenway, quickly, with only a steady murmur of concern for the drive ahead remaining of the roar. Mutability had turned the seasons and translated hope to memory once again. And, once again, she had used baseball, our best invention to stay change, to bring change on. That is why it breaks my heart, that game--not because in New York they could win because Boston lost; in that, there is a rough justice, and a reminder to the Yankees of how slight and fragile are the circumstances that exalt one group of human beings over another. It breaks my heart because it was meant to, because it was meant to foster in me again the illusion that there was something abiding, some pattern and some impulse that could come together to make a reality that would resist the corrosion; and because, after it had fostered again that most hungered-for illusion, the game was meant to stop, and betray precisely what it promised.",https://reddit.com/r/Padres/comments/1nwkx5e/the_green_fields_of_the_mind/,2025-10-03T00:33:29+00:00,Yankees,6985

reddit_post,Padres,Choobeen,"Cubs name NL Wild Card Series Game 2 starter vs. Padres, and it's a surprise CHICAGO ‚Äî The Cubs will be creative as they look to advance to the NL Division Series. The Cubs announced that right-handed reliever Andrew Kittredge will start Game 2 of the NL Wild Card Series against the San Diego Padres on Wednesday afternoon at Wrigley Field. Kittredge likely will serve as an opener, with a length option ‚Äî such as Shota Imanaga ‚Äî to follow. Kittredge entered the Cubs‚Äô 3-1 Game 1 win over the Padres in the eighth inning Tuesday and threw a perfect frame, complete with a strikeout of San Diego slugger Fernando Tatis Jr. It is the first time in 115 years the Cubs will have a starting pitcher in a postseason game with zero days rest. Kittredge, 35, pitched to a 3.40 ERA over 53 innings in 2025, including a 3.32 ERA in 21.2 innings with the Cubs after they acquired him from the Baltimore Orioles at the MLB trade deadline. Cubs manager Craig Counsell will want to use an opener to maximize the matchups atop the Padres‚Äô lineup. Using a right-hander to start the game is a way for the Cubs to combat righty sluggers Tatis and Manny Machado, who hit in the Padres‚Äô Nos. 1 and 3 spots, respectively, in Tuesday‚Äôs lineup. After that pocket, it‚Äôs possible ‚Äî and likely ‚Äî that Counsell will turn to Imanaga as a bulk option. The Padres have struggled against left-handed pitchers this season, ranking 19th in baseball in OPS against southpaws. They started five left-handed hitters in their lineup Tuesday against Cubs lefty Matthew Boyd, including three in a row in the Nos. 6 through 8 spots. Having Imanaga enter there could be a perfect matchup situation and help mitigate some of his recent struggles. The 32-year-old lefty has a 3.28 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in 318 career big-league innings over the last two years, but he carried a 6.51 ERA in five September starts to end the year, allowing 10 home runs. Imanaga allowed eight runs on nine hits in 5.2 innings in his final outing of the year on Sept. 25 against the New York Mets.

reddit_comment,Padres,Simodine-,The Mets have a better offense. The reds have much better starting pitching. The Dodgers have great starting pitching. Which will likely shutdown the Mets offense. The best chance of the dodgers losing is them not scoring. So I don‚Äôt have much faith in either beating the dodgers. I‚Äôd go with the reds. In a low scoring game anything can happen. The reds one pitching weakness is their pen but they will likely put some starters in the pen. The only chance I give the Mets is if their rookie McLean started game one and shoved.

reddit_comment,Padres,Rooks4,"It's easy to blame the ump there, but you can't wait till the 9th inning to show any sign of life offensively. We blew this game by not showing anything offensively. At all. Luis should have scored but decided not to run to first base. Tatis decided to take the day off. Manny, Crone, Arraez, complete choke job. We didn't deserve to win. It's as simple as that. Not sure what to do next year. When Manny and Tatis are invisible there's not much the rest of the team can do. Still, it was a fun season. Love you guys.

reddit_comment,Padres,Rooks4,"Welp, we've made it a series which is great. We've had plenty of dropped game 1 only to win the series all season, so this isn't new to us. Hope Yu has his good stuff. Cubs hitters do NOT have good numbers against him, but of course anything is possible in the playoffs. We need excellence from the pitchers (which have already been excellent), and the hitters really need to have a strong showing today. They've been milquetoast at best the last two games. Really need them showing out tonight. Excited either way. We've had a great season, and I'd hate for it to end already but I can honestly say I'm happy with where we are at considering all the injuries we've had to deal with this year. The next few years are still bright. That being said.. since we are already here in October, we might as well just keep fucking winning. For Peter. LFGSD!

reddit_comment,Padres,Djaukamo,Dylan Cease showing the fuck up with the season on the line with 3.2 gritty innings with 5 K‚Äôs only getting pulled by a conservative Mike Shildt move (ultimately paid off but still debatable)??? Tatis with the leadoff base hit followed by Arraez with the base hit of his own with both advancing on the double steal followed up by Jackson delivering the deep sac fly for the 1-0 lead to counter the Cubs pitching over management??? Xander with the leaping catch and heroic diving base tag attempt (fuck you ump and NY video review center that was a double play)??? Morejon mounting up first to get the final out of the 4th inning hyping himself up with his own energy to power through the 1-2-3 5th before mounting up again for the 1-2-3 6th highlighted by kicking the baseball to 1B for the first out of the inning??? Tatis showing patience drawing a walk advancing on the questionable 1 out bunt by Arraez before getting knocked in by Manny Fucking Machado‚Äôs 2 run bomb for his first hit of the postseason extending his franchise record for the most postseason home runs by a single Padre to 8??? Mason Miller mounting up averaging 103 on his fastballs dumbfounding the Cubs apologist commentators with a 104mph K on his way to the 1-2-3 7th all down by way of the K before mounting up again in the 8th striking out the first two batters to make it eight straight K‚Äôs in the series before being tagged out by Bobby Fastballs drawing the deep fly ball for Platinum Glove Tatis‚Äô highlight catch to end the inning before mounting back up for the 9th inning save capped off by the game ending double play to clinch the shutout win??? Forcing a win or go home game 3 that should be played in prime time not at noon PST??? Edit: acknowledging that pulling Dylan wasn‚Äôt necessarily debatable given his pattern during the regular season. He did his job and the horsemen did theirs.

reddit_post,Padres,jayman415,"Statcast review of offense I know Statcast is not the end all, but does help give some context. The Padres could have easily won that game with a less bad luck and no Estrada wild pitch. This shows xBA (expected BA) which is not expected OPS or wOBA, and not all hits the same. But the Padres did put a charge into the ball and had little to show for it, especially early in the game when the scoring leverage was the highest: https://preview.redd.it/0688urnxijsf1.jpg?width=537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78b37d7a7d2843692037fc93bcd1120cc5ae8287 So despite about 50% better expected BA they had 33% fewer hits. Bad luck. Looking at Exit Velocities > 100 mph, see some of this bad luck playing against the Padres and in favor of the Cubs: https://preview.redd.it/epo9cv3kjjsf1.jpg?width=1001&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee8692a196a7697110a51f6161697884cbf1b479 Suzuki HR obviously legit, but Machado and Boegarts both had well struck balls get snagged. Kelly's HR was a bit lucky. Looking at similar cut but sorted by top 10 xBA (expected BA): https://preview.redd.it/22d3tkfbkjsf1.jpg?width=996&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47e7cac42119b692817608fb015d07309df2120f Padres had 8 of the top 10 expected BA and had 3 hits from hit, 3/8. Chicago 2/2. I think O'Hearn's first two PA's summed it up well: Boegarts at 3rd, no outs. Hits a low, sharp ball, right at Swanson, who snagged it. Swanson is an elite SS but if that ball is just off a little bit either way, looking at very different inning. 101.2, 1 LA. Sac Fly probably better but very nearly a hit. Next PA, 1rst and 3rd, 1 out (that sole out was the indefensible sac bunt by Merrill; effing ridiculous). O'Hearn gets jammed, but being big and strong, muscles the ball into shallow center which is almost always a hit. Again, Swanson. snags it for an amazing play. Elite defense, again, but very nearly another run in. Tatis, Sheets, Arraez, Cronenworth all had pretty forgettable days, half the line up, so not great. But the Padres only gave up two earned runs and easily could have had 3-4.

reddit_comment,Padres,MarkGrantsSheleighly,I agree completely but I'll just add great defense definitely played a factor in some balls hitting the ground or not. Very tight margins and the game could have easily looked a lot different. Let's just hope Merril doesnt lay down another rogue bunt.,https://reddit.com/r/Padres/comments/1nvg6bm/statcast_review_of_offense/nh8cu2a/,2025-10-01T18:40:53+00:00,Cubs,251

reddit_post,Padres,inalavalamp,"Thoughts: Padres had more ‚Äúhard hit‚Äù balls than Cubs today‚Ä¶ sometimes it doesn‚Äôt fall their way. This is baseball: a screaming line drive right to the center fielder. Padres had a total of 14 ‚Äúhard hit‚Äù balls (95mph or over), while Cubs recorded exactly half of that, with 7. Only one of the homers (Suzuki) was recorded as ‚Äúhard hit.‚Äù Eight of the Padres hard hit balls were recorded for outs in the outfield, and 4 of them outs in the infield. The other two are the double for Xander, and the single for Fermin. Very little balls in the gap, through the holes, or down the line. Four hits for Padres, and 6 for the Cubs. Only 6 Ks for Padres, and 13 for Cubs! To me, with 8 hard hit outs to the outfield, seems like they WERE trying to slug a bit, but Cubs have home field advantage with respect to navigating the wind. I don‚Äôt think this was ‚Äúsmall ball‚Äù as some might suggest, but simply how the game of baseball works sometimes, with balls not finding grass or a gap (good defense by Swanson too). Even just 2 singles today with RISP would‚Äôve been a different ball game. It wasn‚Äôt a lack of slug, but a lack of hits, or ANY kind of production. Whatever happens, happens.

reddit_comment,Padres,BubbityDog,"What cracked me up about Suzuki's HR on Statcast was that it was a HR in every MLB park except Coors. Now THAT'S baseball. Ultimately the postseason is a home run derby because (outside of the occasional blowout) you are always going to be facing the other team's best pitching, which is likely already above league average. If you get out-homered by the other team, you are probably going to lose. Looking at the past 10 years of postseason history bears that out.

I remember watching those games on TV back then and seeing fans hang teddy bears at Jack Murphy to taunt the Cubs. It stuck with me ever since. There are several articles and game write-ups that mention it, but my family does not believe me because I have never been able to show any actual photos as proof.

reddit_post,Padres,PutAWrenchInMeImDone,"Cheers to transient friendships with Faithful strangers! This is an appreciation post for some momentary camaraderie and friendship I experienced watching Game 1 yesterday at a local brewery. I unexpectedly found myself with a block of time from 12-2pm before my next gig, so I parked myself at a brewery, ordered a beer and a pretzel, and began watching with hopeful anticipation as my Padres were minutes away from embarking on another (and, to us long-suffering San Diego baseball fans, PRECIOUS) quest for their first World Series title. Before long, two friendly ladies wearing Padres caps each separately sat at the open seats at my corner of the bar, one dodging work and one working distractedly on her laptop. We quickly began chatting and discovered that we were all native San Diegans, all around the same age. We cheered together, when Merrill and Bogaerts rallied to give us a one-run lead in the second inning, each time Pivetta got another big time strikeout. We commiserated when the solo shots by Suzuki and Kelly put us behind later in the game. All the while, we talked and got to know each other. They were gracious in being open to making a spontaneous connection with a stranger, and in sharing nachos and french fries. For that fleeting two hours before one and then another of us had to get back to life before the game had ended, we were pals bonded temporarily over our love for these damn Padres. Despite all of the years of futility and disappointment, our affinity for our team brought us together. Eventually losing the game sucked, but because of the time I got to spend with these generous and welcoming fellow human beings, I came away from the experience feeling good and happy. I knew the Padres might very well break my heart the next day, but the transient friendship I got to be a part of put it all into perspective for me. At the end of the day, it's just a baseball game. And without the human connections we make in our fandom, what would it all be for anyway? So to the two momentary friends I made yesterday, thanks for making my life brighter!

Guide Cronenworth to clutch when it matters, And Merrill‚Äôs youth to silence the doubters. Lift up Ryan O‚ÄôHearn when the moment is tight, And grant Sheets the swing to send balls to flight. Keep Elias D√≠az sturdy behind the plate, And Jos√© Iglesias sure-handed and great. On the mound, let Cease bring his flame, And Darvish endure with wisdom and game. Steady King for innings long, And let Pivetta‚Äôs arm stay strong. Grant Cort√©s his craft, lefty and sly, And Su√°rez the saves that make spirits fly. Bless Matsui, and Rodr√≠guez too, May every pitch they hurl bring glory so true. Ignite Mason Miller, fire untamed, And Estrada, with strikeouts proclaimed. Hold Peralta and Morej√≥n upright, So the bullpen endures each October night. Father, keep health upon this team, Turn heartbreak past into realized dream.

The official MLB international online store definitely has one but it's full of just fanatics stuff, and the selection is even more lacking imo. Also I heard that fanatics stores are not the best places to buy MLB gear at. Amazon is definitely not the most reputable place for buying this type of stuff.

reddit_comment,Padres,SiteNew8835,Good luck today Padres fans. I was raised a Cubs fan. I have an 11 year old who is a Padres fan. We went to spring training this last spring and I have to say I was very impressed with everything about the Padres. The fans were all really nice and the players actually took their time to sign a bunch of baseballs for all the kids(got the starting line up minus Tatis). Hats off to the team for that. Manny Machado became one of my current favorite players over that weekend. As we sat at the Cubs field during spring training not one interaction with players. That being said. Good luck Padres.

reddit_comment,Padres,Djaukamo,Michael King with the tuneup appearance getting 3 K's over 2.2 innings before getting tagged out by Yuki who got 7 outs on 37 pitches??? Tatis looking like he's back with his leadoff 413 foot bomb to the upper deck of the Western Metal building followed by Luis Arraez extending his hit streak to 15 games followed by Xander deciding to one up Tatis with a 424 foot bomb to the same spot to make it 3-0??? Bro'Hearn with the leadoff double getting knocked in by Elias Diaz's homer to make it 5-0??? Padres finding their slugging just in time for their trip to Chicago for the Wild Card??? Morejon mounting up first for 3 outs on 8 pitches followed by Mason Miller with the 1-2-3 7th all down by way of the K followed by Jeremiah Estrada with 3 outs on 18 pitxhe sall down by way of the K followed by Suarez with the tuneup closing it out for the last night game of the regular season for win 89???

reddit_comment,Padres,Djaukamo,Yu Darvish getting run support to make up for the two solo shots he allowed on his way to 5 innings with 4 K‚Äôs on 79 pitches??? The Ferminator teaching Blaze a lesson for trying to steal with the textbook throwout to second??? Jackson Merrill stepping in to help Tatis out to gun down dumb-dumb Perdomo who ran out of gas trying to reach third??? Xander getting his first hit since his return with the leadoff single advancing on Gavin‚Äôs base hit before scoring on O‚ÄôHearn‚Äôs RBI single that also saw Gavin advance to third with no hesitation followed by The Ferminator‚Äôs walk to load the bases FOR O NANDO WHO PLAYS FOR SLAM DIEGO WITH THE THROWBACK BOMB TO MAKE IT 5-2??? Tatis recovering from the near-miss catch attempt to snatch the ball with his barehand and gun down Vargas who hopped off second base like a dumb-dumb as Xander was tagging him??? Manny with the leadoff walk advancing on Xander‚Äôs second base hit of the day who then scared Perdomo into dropping the gimme groundout ball Gavin hit to instead load the bases followed by Jake scaring in a run with the walk to make it 6-2??? Rodriguez mounting up first to get through the 6th with 2 K‚Äôs followed by Wandy recovering from the near throw out at first to get through the 7th followed by Miller Time to bail out Hart and Morgan escaping the Diamondbacks 8th inning rally with a 2 run lead intact??? Luis Arraez with the 2 out base hit for his 4th of the day followed by Manny with his 1st of the day inspiring Jackson to get his first hit of the day with the RBI single capped off by Luis Arraez‚Äôs beautiful slide to score??? Mason Miller mounting back up for the 10 pitch 9th for the save to secure win 88 on the season and the final game in these city connect jerseys??? Edit: still not a 0% chance to host a wild card game???

reddit_post,Padres,PerceptionWrong,"Upsides from the Postseason In all the sadness from today loss, there are some good things that came from the experience. In the short sample size of post season baseball, we know that‚Ä¶ Merrill is a fighter. Definitely top 3 best hitters for us this postseason (which wasn‚Äôt that hard but still he had a great 3 games all in all) and he refused to let the teams energy effect him, and gave us all a little hope. X‚Äôs contract has started off well enough, he was the exact veteran presence that Machado is supposed to be, and had high game sense. Additionally for the lack of contributions offense wise, his defense has seemingly taken a massive upturn and he looks more and more like a solid shortstop for years to come. Fermin is a dawg. He was easily our best player this postseason offensive and potentially all around. So excited to see how he (hopefully) grows into an even better all around player. Miller is going to be a perennial reliever of the year candidate (as long as he stays a reliever), and is untouchable. Pivetta has stepped into an ace in our starting lineup and just saw no run support his last like 10 starts.

reddit_comment,Padres,odd_on_purpose,Tatis bat was disappointing this year but defense was elite. Loved watching him find new ways to rob homers over the right field fence. Jackson struggled a lot during the season but found his way back by the end. I look forward to seeing him be a monster next season. Miller was the highlight of the wild card for me.

reddit_comment,Padres,Dry-Foundation7205,"Fermin, Bogaerts and Merrill really showed up on offense. O'Hearn to an extent. Sheets is exempted, we literally got him on our team for nothing and I'm eternally grateful to him regardless. Cease was our best pitcher surprisingly. That being said he's probably gone unless by some miracle we sign him. And Pivetta gave us a chance in game one, which is all that matters. Miller was dominant. No explanation. But who choked big time? Tatis and to an extent Manny. That homer in game two was honestly clutch, but that was his only hit. You just can't do that. And Tatis didn't perform at all. Zero home runs from Fernando, an absolute mystery as to where his spark went this postseason. And I see a lot of people hating on Crone. That's understandable, he was our worst player in this postseason. But idk man, I just can't bring myself to hate on the Crone Zone. This season was a big disappointment. Trust me I might seems somewhat stable right now but earlier I was throwing my baseball at the wall trying to breeak that shit. But idk man, all eyes are on next season. We need to lock down some SP and fix the goddamn offense. In my humble opinion, just build around Merrill. Make it clear that he is the future of this franchise.

reddit_comment,Padres,trade_tsunami,"As far as I'm concerned we got to witness the most dominant, badass postseason relief pitching performance ever by Mason Miller. The two brightest spots of the series to me were Miller and Fermin who are both Padres for the coming years. Laureano is a team option who is clearly worth it. The O'Hearn rental departing to free agency isn't going to hurt much after he more or less no showed in the postseason. Lastly, this may be wishful thinking but I think we'll get some changes to this team's archaic small ball philosophy after our offense pooped the bed as usual with RISP.

Hi everyone, As with past years, traffic to the subreddit will increase dramatically over the next few weeks. The further that we get into the postseason, the more traffic we will see. This causes an influx of individuals who are bad actors (trolls, people botching about gambling losses, etc.) or who are unfamiliar with our subreddit rules. Normally, during the course of the regular season, the moderation team looks at the individuals profile, the severity of the infraction, history on the sub, previously removed comments, etc. when determining if a ban should be issued, and for how long. But for the reasons that I‚Äôve mentioned above‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt nobody got time for that.‚Äù The minimum length of any ban will be through the end of Game 7 of the World Series (November 1st) until such time as the Padres postseason run has concluded. This helps ensure that the moderation team does not have to deal with repeat offenders during a time when we are otherwise more busy than usual. So, for those of you who have been around for a while and know the rules, it is extra important that you follow them for the next several weeks or you may find yourselves unable to celebrate with the rest of us‚Ä¶ (‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢) / ( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)>‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ† / (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†) after the padres win the World Series.",https://reddit.com/r/Padres/comments/1ntkitq/postseason_conduct_policy_is_in_effect_all_bans/,2025-09-29T15:07:37+00:00,A's,1356
reddit_post,Padres,bisexual_obama,"Theory about Dylan Cease Dylan Cease isn't having the best year. His ERA of 4.55 is above league average, yet his FIP is 3.56, well below league average. The difference between the two is FIP doesn't account for balls in play. FIP is often the better tool to evaluate pitchers, because it depends less on the strength of the fielding and BABIP luck. Related, the first thing you notice about the name ""Dylan Cease"" is that it has an even number of letters. The same is true if we used his full name Dylan Edward Cease. Given this you'd suspect that such a boy would be destined to be born in an even number year, yet he was born in 1995. However, on closer inspection, he was born on December 28th 1995. He missed 1996 by 4 days! Now let's take a look at his BABIP. The results are striking, every odd number year the batters he face have a BABIP above .310, yet it's below .270 on even number years. That's a huge difference, and as we know luck plays a huge role in BABIP, even over a whole season. We know that Dylan isn't having the best year, but I don't think he's to blame. Due to a cosmic misstep he was born in a year with the wrong parity, which gives him bad luck on odd number years. I think we'll see improvement from him in the future.",https://reddit.com/r/Padres/comments/1ns35v1/theory_about_dylan_cease/,2025-09-27T18:54:04+00:00,A's,1249

reddit_post,Padres,kramerattack,"We Don't Dig the Long Ball: A Look at the 2025 Padres Pitching and Allowing Home Runs With the apparent struggles of the 2025 Padres starting pitching to prevent home runs, particularly early in games, I was curious how big of an issue this has really been. Is it a legitimate issue going into the playoffs? Or do the stats say otherwise? Lets investigate. Darvish giving up more homers tonight, including another in the first inning, inspired this post. So I started by looking at him. Tonight is the 15th start of the season for Darvish. He has given up home runs in 10 of 15 starts. Last start before tonight he didn't give up a homer, which broke a streak of EIGHT straight starts giving up a home run. Seems pretty dire, and as the stats below show he is in a down year. But it's not as bad as it would seem overall. Padres starters have given up the 12th most home runs of any team. Ironically they also rank 12th in number of first inning home runs. So let's keep going, and look at where they rank in the number of home runs allowed by inning. This is ranked by most home runs allowed, so lower the ranking the better. If you rank high, you're giving up less home runs. Lower the rank, the more home runs given up. 1st Inning: 12th 2nd Inning: 25th 3rd Inning: 9th 4th Inning: 10th 5th Inning: 3rd 6th Inning: 15th 7th Inning: 29th 8th Inning: 26th 9th Inning: 17th Extras: Tied for 24th with none allowed So what can we take away from those rankings? In the first two innings, the pitching isn't too bad at preventing homers. And in the late innings, it's elite. In particular in the 7th and 8th. No surprise with an elite bullpen, and having guys like Adam, Miller, and Morejon throwing those critical setup innings most of the time. The weak spot is innings 3-5, where the Padres are among the bottom 10 teams in preventing homers, including 3rd worst in the 5th inning. This makes sense when we dig into the stats for the starters further. Padres starters are 21st in innings pitched, and 16th in ERA (4.10). They have 48 quality starts (6 IP with 3 or fewer ER), ranking in the bottom third of the league. Just 30% of games resulted in quality starts, under the 35% league average. So starters aren't going deep into games. Meaning that those middle innings are being thrown mostly by starters who are struggling already in the game, or low leverage relievers with less than stellar numbers like Peralta, Matsui, etc. I decided to look at situational pitching, and noticed this. When ahead in the count, the Padres have given up the FOURTH most home runs. When behind in the count? They are the BEST IN MLB at preventing home runs. A mental issue? Strikeout pitches missing their spots? I don't know if it proves anything, but it was interesting and jumped out at me. (Side note: MLB.com didn't specify if this stat is when the batter is ahead/behind in the count or the pitcher. But since I was looking at pitching stats specifically, I am assuming they mean where the pitcher is in the count. So more strikes is ahead in the count, and more balls is behind.) Here are the stats for home runs allowed per 9 innings for our starters: Pivetta: 1.1 HR/9 (Career best) Cease: 1.1 HR/9 (Career average is 1.1) Darvish: 1.6 HR/9 (Career worst was 1.7 in 2019, career average is 1.2) Vasquez: 1.1 HR/9 (Career average is 1.1) King: 1.5 HR/9 (Had been averaging under 1.0 since becoming a starter) Kolek: 0.7 HR/9 (Short sample size so far in career, but at about his average so far) All other starters this season have had limited starts/innings. Bergert was solid (1.0 HR/9). Hart hasn't been great, but not awful (1.9 HR/9). Cortes and Sears have had awful years with the long ball (2.7 and 2.8 HR/9 respectively). So at the end of the day, lack of depth seems to be the issue. Not necessarily an especially bad year statistically. The consistent starters have been about average (and in the case of Pivetta and Vasquez quite good) at allowing home runs, and the overall team is above average thanks to the bullpen. But a lot of innings have had to go to spot starters and low leverage relievers due to lack of starting pitching depth. This, in theory, is good news for the playoffs. With short series, starting pitching depth is less of an issue. Overall depth is important, but they have that with a good bullpen. Pivetta and Vasquez have been good at preventing homers, and can lead a postseason rotation. Cease has also been strong at preventing homers. King and Darvish are in down years for home runs, but you can have a quicker leash with them in the postseason to help mitigate that. All that is to say that as long as the bullpen does well, we can overcome any issues with starting pitching and home runs. As someone who was very worried about this, especially when combined with the below average slugging of our own offense, it was encouraging to see going into the playoffs.",https://reddit.com/r/Padres/comments/1nrmctk/we_dont_dig_the_long_ball_a_look_at_the_2025/,2025-09-27T04:44:57+00:00,A's,4895

reddit_comment,Padres,LongjumpingOwl1444,"This is great analysis. The 2025 season regarding pitching has just been such a massive headscratcher. I for one believe this team is legit and it's been an up and down year. Start of the season with Nando on fire, Manny picked it up for us in May-June. Boggy having that mid season rut. It felt like every at bat he had it was a sure out (glad he seems to get back in his groove). Guys like Sheets has been a massive blessing in disguise. Despite this, our offensive has felt a bit slower at times. The trade deadline looked to pay off, at least maybe in the short term. I still love the fact we have control over Miller for a good chunk of time. Following on pitching, I agree with you in terms of the playoffs. In theory, one would hope we could bring competitive pitching in a shorter series (Wildcard/NLDS). Luckily our record after leading after the 6th is top 5 in the MLB. Could a guy like Cease or King come out of the bullpen? Does Vasquez have a valid plea to start in a game? Lots of questions coming into the Wildcard matchup against the Cubs. I've been cautiously optimistic this entire year. It's easy to say we're missing pieces, but so are other teams. When I went to STL to see the Pads play the Cards, I told all the Cards fans we have 3 relievers, the 3 Horseman (before Miller was added). I'm curious to see what we got come next week. Overall, this was an awesome post, nothing is more enjoyable than talking baseball with people that talk based on facts and good observations, not just pure emotion. I'm curious to see other perspectives. KTD!",https://reddit.com/r/Padres/comments/1nrmctk/we_dont_dig_the_long_ball_a_look_at_the_2025/ngfl74z/,2025-09-27T05:12:17+00:00,A's,1566
reddit_post,azdiamondbacks,TechnicalLeave6989,"Arizona Dbacks‚Äô Unlikely and Rapid Ascent to 2001 World Series Glory The 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks achieved what many thought impossible. In just their fourth season, an expansion team burst onto the scene and took down baseball‚Äôs best, culminating in a World Series title. With an underdog roster packed with veterans, the Diamondbacks were anything but a typical championship team. They beat three perennial powerhouses, the St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, and New York Yankees to claim their first-ever championship. This wasn‚Äôt just a story of great pitching or timely hits; it was about a team that overachieved, against all odds, and delivered one of the most shocking stories in baseball history.

It isn‚Äôt easy being a fan out here; nobody to cheer with, constant teasing from friends and family. Literally just sat in my room all day with a lame expression on my face. I got a good jump of happiness when the cards caught up, only to lose it with seconds left. I had anticipated going out tonight for happy hour as well, but I was feeling so bummed out from the Dbacks loss, I didn‚Äôt even leave the house. I love these teams so much, and I won‚Äôt stop being a fan. But it certainly does hurt.

reddit_post,azdiamondbacks,InterestingFigure642,"Hello from a returning fan I grew up in PHX until I was a preteen. Some of my favorite memories were going to Bank One Ballpark back in the 2003-2004 era. I remember being one in a pack of kids desperately calling out to Randy, hoping to get his attention enough for an autograph. I moved out of Arizona and moved overseas to Peru, where most people prefer to follow soccer and volleyball. There was little reason to keep up with the team, and unfortunately there wasn't enough success to draw me out. I returned to AZ for the first time in a decade two weeks ago. Visited old friends and family and made up for lost time. Of course, I also needed to return to see the Dbacks. I went with two close friends to the game versus the Giants on 9/16 and can report that it was breathtaking. I was immediately disheartened that we were down 4-0 before we even sat down. However, I was excited to see how it went and was moved by how the team chipped away at the lead to snatch victory in the last moment. It was an amazing experience that left me hungry for more. I know everyone here is sore from the last week's performance. I would like to highlight that we came a lot further than we had expected from our recent setbacks and injuries. That first game against the Dodgers showed that we could do the job, we do have a team that's capable of fighting back and coming out on top. I have come to admire the Dbacks for their tenacity and perseverance. I can assure everyone here that I will continue to follow the team's exploits and hope to share victory with all of you next year.

reddit_comment,azdiamondbacks,Relevant_Computer743,"Great content as always! Love what you and Jesse bring to the table. With the bullpen decision you kind of touched on it when talking about how the decision was made to go with a bullpen game. As you mentioned, the bullpen game was going to happen one way or another. It was just a matter of if it was against the Padres or the Dodgers. The clip that Jesse referenced from Jim Bowden [around the 52 minute mark.](https://www.youtube.com/live/UBDspkee5BQ?si=iMHRAURfcTowEMte) talks about the behind the scenes process where the analytics team, Torey, the pitching coach, Gallen and E-Rod were all part of the conversation. This isn't Torey just unilaterally making the decisions. I'm not sure many people online realize that based on the calls to have Torey fired (not saying you have ever called for this or even implied it. Just a lot of people on social media and in the game threads wanting him fired). Changing the manager may not have the full impact that people online think it will. So much of the decision is data driven behind the scenes. Has Torey made some bad decisions this year that lost games? 100% but so does every manager. That comes with playing 162 games a year. Not every manager makes the right move every time. Dave Roberts has lost a lot of games lately because his bullpen has imploded. I look at Saturday in the bigger picture of this franchise. The loss on Saturday to me shows just how incomplete this team is still which isn't a surprise given that we sold at the deadline. Once we got rid of Naylor, Suarez, Kelly, etc. we knew the lineup was going to take a step back to help the future of the team via prospects. Everyone not named Marte, Perdomo, or Carroll went 4/27 (.148) on Friday. That simply cannot happen. If we were to sneak into the playoffs this year that's exactly how teams are going to face us. Make anybody other than Marte, Carroll, Perdomo beat you. We need somebody else to step up in the clutch. Too many black holes on the current roster that Torey is forced to use because we sold. Alek, Jake, and Barrosa are all the same player. Defense first and very little offense. Yes I know Alek had 2 hits against Ohtani and Barrosa has had his moments lately. This comes down to how Hazen handles the off-season IMHO if we can flip into an actual contender next year instead of hoping other teams collapse and we can fall backwards into the playoffs. One of Jake or Alek needs to go. Find an OFer that can at least hit league average and play decent defense, which of course we had with Lourdes until his injury. Tawa hasn't shown the ability to hit after his initial run. We need to find a way to bolster the bottom end of the lineup going into next season if we want to get to the playoffs and make a deep run.",https://reddit.com/r/azdiamondbacks/comments/1nr0xkg/snakes_territory_podcast/ngbhycz/,2025-09-26T15:12:40+00:00,Dodgers,2757

reddit_comment,azdiamondbacks,EmanonProjekt,"I like ur attitude! Your right .5 game ot of WC as you say after selling at the deadline is a success. Successful in pointing out the ineptitude of Torrey. He was forced to sell, and keep the young talent up here to get consistent reps and they performed well. Unlike in the middle of the season were he would call them up, sit them for 6 games, get them a start and sit them for 4 more, then throw his hands up cause they aren't performing lol. I said it early and ill say it again love him or not Geno, was a liability hitting for long stretches, almost predictable high fastball and or slider strikeouts in critical moments. Yes he finishes on his averages but his incredibly long droughts are costly. Defensively he has way to many errors and basically is just not athletic. But I got crucified for those facts. In comes blaze, more consistent at the plate, good enough power and 100 times more athletic. The guy loved Tim Tawa and used him way more than he should, Vargas should have made the team out of spring instead of Tawa, he was RAKING in spring training. Tawa was okay at best. Just way to many bad decisions and the worst of it all is its a pattern over time. I will say obviously injuries crushed us, but so did the early season 2 days on 1 off rotation for the players. I know the training staff has that responsibility or whatever, but there are certain games and series that matter even early on and you have to recognize that. All is forgiven if you win ball games and there's no actual data that says giving players rest early in the season prevents injuries or makes them fresher at the end. I mean Ketel, still had a hamstring injury, Corbin still had a hand injury, Gabby still had a hand injury, like losing those critical games for ""rest"" didnt prevent anything and only cost us. I'd venture to argue these guys are athletes and to much rest while they are getting ramped up may potentially LEAD to injury. Your body running hot/cold/hot/cold may result in injury so why risk any of it. Anyway my rant is over. For the record I love Torrey i just think that sometimes he's got to put his foot down manage this team and sometimes he has to make the unpopular decision, no matter how loved a guy is in the club house, he's just a bit too much a players manager for me.",https://reddit.com/r/azdiamondbacks/comments/1nrnnx7/i_dont_care_what_anyone_says_this_was_a_half/ngh8sy7/,2025-09-27T13:43:40+00:00,Padres,2291

reddit_comment,azdiamondbacks,KevinDurantLebronnin,Man I had a blast watching this team make a late run. More fun than I thought this team would ever manage to be this season. Didn't think they'd even sniff that last WC spot a couple months ago. Can't be too upset they came up short of a goal that was always gonna take a bit if a miracle. Hell it looked unrealistic **before** they sold at the deadline. Great fight despite the struggles.

reddit_comment,azdiamondbacks,Matt_Ordazam,"on 8/2 we were 51-59 and the season looked all but over. traded away geno, naylor, and one of our best pitchers ever in kelly. they easily could‚Äôve rolled over and just accepted defeat. instead, they clawed and fought their way back into post season consideration. the fact that we even played meaningful september baseball is a testament to how this group doesn‚Äôt give up. a disappointing end to the season, but i‚Äôm proud of the boys nonetheless. fix the bullpen, sign some guys back, and don‚Äôt forget to turn the injury slider off next season. ladies and gentlesnakes, it‚Äôs been a privilege watching this season with you all üêç and ofc FTD",https://reddit.com/r/azdiamondbacks/comments/1nrmkvf/postgame_thread_926_dbacks_8080_padres_8872/ngfl26z/,2025-09-27T05:11:06+00:00,Padres,640

Might work if they do the DH thing they did this season at the end but I am not sure either has a strong enough bat to deserve a full time DH spot against LHP.,https://reddit.com/r/azdiamondbacks/comments/1ntqyex/the_value_of_james_mccann_this_season_was/ngw0ssi/,2025-09-29T20:18:49+00:00,Diamondbacks,355
reddit_comment,azdiamondbacks,tooOldOriolesfan,"Orioles fans largely were upset when the Orioles made no effort to resign him. I kind of think he might have over valued himself but I don't know. He is tough and solid defensively but can't hit most of the time. DBack fans got one of his best hitting seasons in his career. 107 OPS+. Only the covid year in 2020 and 2019 did he hit better. Career wise he is ops+ 84 which might be ok for a BU catcher. It is hard to judge pitch calling. How much of it is the catcher, the dugout, or the pitcher himself? Probably comes down to $$$. I didn't mind him leaving the Orioles but the Orioles solution was $8.5M for Sanchez which was beyond stupid for a guy who can't catch and can't hit RHPs. He was injured almost the entire season. Too bad the Dbacks missed out on the playoffs.",https://reddit.com/r/azdiamondbacks/comments/1ntqyex/the_value_of_james_mccann_this_season_was/ngx7i4r/,2025-09-30T00:05:43+00:00,Diamondbacks,775

reddit_post,azdiamondbacks,PandarenNinja,"Questions about Diamondbacks broadcasting situation Hey folks, Mariners fan here. Today the Mariners announced they are disbanding from the local regional sports network on cable and that channel is shutting down. As a result they announced the MLB will take over broadcasting games in the local market. They said the diamondbacks have a similar situation (as well as a few other teams). First question‚Ä¶ how has that been for you? What are the pros and cons you‚Äôve seen? I prefer streaming over cable and would love to know how that experience has been. Both in your region as well as when you have to travel (as I do for work sometimes). Second question‚Ä¶ can you help me sort out my confusion on pricing? I found this thread from a year ago‚Ä¶ https://www.reddit.com/r/azdiamondbacks/s/Mifi9aL8fq However when I go to look at pricing myself on the MLB page I see: DBACKS.TV Yearly $19.99/year Stream D-backs games without blackouts live or on demand for the entire 2025 regular season. Plus, access to MiLB games and MLB Big Inning. DBACKS.TV & MLB.TV Yearly $39.99/vear Stream D-backs games without blackouts for the entire 2025 regular season as well as every other team's out-of-market games live or on demand, plus access to MLB Network for the 2025 season and offseason, our best value. These prices are magnitudes different than the ones from that year-old thread. I can‚Äôt imagine they dropped by almost $100 in one season. So I‚Äôm probably missing something obvious and could use some help figuring out the REAL current pricing as I try to predict what they will charge in the Seattle market. That‚Äôs all. Thanks folks! Edit: 1 more question! I am a streamer and don‚Äôt like cable. But my parents and other family members (in the mariners market) are kind of set on cable. Is it possible to still get your team on a cable channel? Presumably MLB TV? Or are the diamondbacks streaming-only now?",https://reddit.com/r/azdiamondbacks/comments/1nrgzvk/questions_about_diamondbacks_broadcasting/,2025-09-27T00:04:29+00:00,Diamondbacks,1896

The ability to stream games on multiple devices is great as I've been able to turn on the games and watch when I'm at work or out of town. As far as pricing goes, the prices you are seeing now are end of season discounted prices. The cost of MLB.TV drops throughout the season so you are not charged full price if you start streaming halfway through the year. The prices listed in the link are accurate for what you should expect to pay if you start streaming at the beginning of next season.

reddit_comment,azdiamondbacks,ajteitel,"I think they will try, but he did have his best offensive season since 2019/2020. Or 2017 if you remove the juiced balls lol. There are always teams that need a catcher that can be trusted to start start for a season. His defense is respectable and bat, for a catcher, is above average the past two years. But he's also going to be 36 next year which may put off some teams who may want to start him for a full season. If the team wants to use him as a platoon DH in some of his off days alongside ADC/Moreno since I don't expect the team to spend for a DH, I can see a good reason to spend a bit extra to bring him back. Also we've said the same thing about our beloved backups before. Remember Kevin Newman? 2.2 WAR for a backup utility man is pretty impressive.

Looking forward to next year, where hopefully this obsession with analytics gets put in check. Sure, trust the numbers, but trust guys like Perdomo more by giving him a chance for that 100 RBI milestone and a memorable win.

He left the Twins after the 2024 season. During his eight years in Minnesota, the Twins won three AL Central titles and earned four postseason berths. > Andy McKay: He's worked in the Mariners' front office since 2015, where he's served under GM/president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto. In December 2024, McKay was promoted to vice president and assistant GM. McKay was the Rockies' peak performance coordinator for the minor league system from 2012 to 2015. Dipoto worked briefly in the Rockies' front office after he retired as a Rockies reliever in 2001. > Jon Daniels: When he became the Rangers‚Äô GM in 2005 at age 28, he was the youngest GM in baseball history. The Rangers won the AL West four times under Daniels (2010-11, ‚Äô15-16), and they reached the World Series in 2010 and ‚Äô11, losing to the Giants and Cardinals. Daniels ran the Rangers' front office for 17 seasons until he was fired in 2022. Since then, he's been a special assistant with the Tampa Bay Rays. > Dayton Moore: Currently a senior advisor of baseball operations with the Rangers, Moore was the architect of the Royals' championship runs a decade ago. Under his leadership, the Royals made the World Series in 2014 and returned to the Fall Classic in 2015, winning the championship. The Royals fired Moore near the end of the 2022 season. He was promoted to president of baseball operations on Sept. 14, 2021, after spending the previous 15 seasons as the Royals‚Äô GM. The Rockies were reportedly interested in hiring Moore in some capacity in 2023, but the move did not materialize. > Billy Eppler: The former Mets GM joined the Brewers as a special adviser for scouting and baseball operations during spring training. Eppler was suspended in 2024 after a Major League Baseball investigation concluded he directed Mets staff to fabricate injuries to create open roster spots. He resigned as the Mets' general manager in October 2023 amid that investigation, three days after owner Steve Cohen hired David Stearns as president of baseball operations. Eppler joined the Mets in November 2021 after working as the Angels' general manager from 2015 to 2020. The Rockies hired Eppler as a scout in 2000.

reddit_comment,ColoradoRockies,IceExile,funny.... one of the Denver TV sportscasters was extra giddy about rockies at least getting SOME all-time worst record: highest E.R.A ever. He was projecting it based on SF's runs scored thru 3rd inning (when he was on the air)... really shameful how much hate local media has for this team--- the same team who is part of the sports scene that allows these parasites to have jobs.

reddit_comment,ColoradoRockies,oleblueeyes75,I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll keep saying it. Monfort looks at baseball as a way to make more money. He doesn‚Äôt even like baseball.

reddit_comment,ColoradoRockies,mtnman575,I've been a fan since the team's inception but the past 3 seasons have been beyond embarrassing. WTAF is this team's management and ownership doing?

reddit_comment,ColoradoRockies,mufasas_son,"In the midst of what was nearly the worst season for any MLB team, ever, Dick Monfort promoted his 39 year old idiot son to be the COO of the team. The Rockies will be garbage forever because the Monforts treat the team like a trust fund. They have no incentive to improve because the taxpayer-funded stadium keeps getting filled up. So long as they own the team, and I suspect Dick will hand it down to one of his kids, this team will be bad.",https://reddit.com/r/ColoradoRockies/comments/1nt15t6/the_season_is_now_mercifully_over_for_the_rox/ngq8p63/,2025-09-28T22:15:12+00:00,Rox,443
