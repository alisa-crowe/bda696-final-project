reddit_post,orioles,Risho96,"End of Season bWAR Party Trevor Rogers’s last start was harshly awarded -.5 bWAR, bringing him to a grand total of 5.5 for the season 0.1 ahead of Gunnar. He’s only lost bWAR twice, and I expect we’ll see some down-ballot Cy Young votes thrown his way. He’s been an absolute joy this season. Cowser has returned to the top twelve by tying Bautista at 1.1 each. Tomo finished with 1.2 for the season, tied with Bradish, who accrued bWAR at a Rogers-esque pace. I wouldn’t be upset to see him back next year, but he can’t be all, and there’s only so much room, unless he’ll take a minor league deal. ありがとう、トモさん😊 Westy and Urias each have us 1.5, with Westy getting eight more games. Adley’s got 1.9 in only five more games than Westy, BroHearn gave us 2.0 in four more games than that, Kremer put up 2.1, and Laureano gave us 3.0 in three games less than Westy. If anyone’s wondering, Charlie Morton gave us -0.1 bWAR, which is impressive, considering the hole he was in early. I wish it’d gone better, but I’m still glad we got to see the good version of Uncle Charlie before he left. Good luck in retirement, unc! 🧡 Our *worst* players by bWAR were Kjerstad with -1.6 and Gibby with -1.1. Personally, I blame the Yankees. Don’t know what they did to Gibby, but I’m sure they did *something* to him. This season may not have turned out anything close to what we expected, but I can’t say it was the worst. Plenty of reason to have hope for next year, and pitching seems to top that list. That and the ABS system. This maybe isn’t what we expected the top twelve to look like when the season began, but the only one to where I wouldn’t have believed you that he’d be on there is Bradish, just because we knew full well he wouldn’t play much. The exact combination, the order, and how we got here are what gets you. Did people like these? Might be neat to actually do a full season of them, and individually track more than just Trevor Rogers. I’d say I’d see y’all next season, but I’m one of these weirdos who pops in here during the offseason from time to time.

reddit_comment,orioles,Big_Red_Professor,These posts were very fun to track. They were very well done. 3 of the top 12 are already not with the team going into the off-season. Fortunately most of the rest of the guys are under team control in some capacity next year. It's going to be interesting to see what this top 12 looks like at the end of next season. The ebbs and flow of the season should have some fun races and interesting names in the top 12 as this team regains it's competitive edge in 2026 Hopefully next year we get to see someone chasing the league WAR lead for pitchers or batters. That would be so awesome,https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ntqt95/end_of_season_bwar_party/ngvptrg/,2025-09-29T19:25:20+00:00,Yankees,583

reddit_post,orioles,The_Big_Untalented,"Eddie Murray: Baseball ‘hasn’t changed for the best' If it were up to Eddie Murray, baseball might be played a little differently. The 69-year-old Murray, an eight-time All-Star who retired after the 1997 season and is one of just seven players in major league history to record 3,000 hits and 500 home runs, took particular issue with how players prepare for games and play defense. “I see throws that come in, short-hop people and stuff like that, some people have no idea how they throw the ball,” he said during the fifth inning of the Orioles’ game Saturday against the New York Yankees as part of his visit to Camden Yards for fan appreciation weekend. “That’s the first thing you’re supposed to do, to me, as an outfielder is know the strength of your own arm.” What bothers the three-time Gold Glove Award winner at first base is an apparent lack of practice fielding. “Something’s got to happen where these guys stay on the field. I don’t like that. But when you come out here, you don’t see anybody working a lot of times. Nobody taking ground balls,” Murray said. “I was out here today, it was an empty field. A couple of guys took swings, but it’s just different.” Former Orioles pitcher and current MASN analyst Ben McDonald chimed in to say that during Murray’s tenure in Baltimore — which lasted from 1977 to 1988 and included the 1983 World Series championship — the club would take batting practice and fielding practice every day under the direction of legendary manager Earl Weaver. “Jim \[Palmer\] would tell you that everything we did was due to defense,” Murray said, gesturing to the Hall of Fame pitcher alongside him in the MASN booth. “That was the first thing we had to do. You had to learn how to catch the ball, or you weren’t allowed to be on the field.” [Orioles' Eddie Murray: Baseball 'hasn't changed for the best'](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/09/20/orioles-eddie-murray-masn-comments-baseball/)",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ntneoc/eddie_murray_baseball_hasnt_changed_for_the_best/,2025-09-29T16:56:08+00:00,Yankees,1934
reddit_comment,orioles,Loose_Log_6253,"Is this a comment on the Os, or both teams there (i.e. the Yankees)? Because if the former, I think it's an illustration of the issue of having a team made entirely of young guys. Defense, at least in terms of arm and error rate, is refined by repetition as you age. Range decreases as you get older but you probably hit a sweet spot around 27-33 years old. Half of the infield hasn't played their position for more than a year. And Mayo does exactly what Murray recommends: he said he fields hundreds of grounders with Mabry every single day. Holliday was rushed through the minors too fast to be a good 2B any time soon. Gunnar has dramatically improved from last year, showing how long to can take too. I'm not saying he's wrong, I think it's more his point highlights one of the issues of having a super young team. But if he's saying that with regard to the Yankees also, yeah I agree. Their defense, without looking it up, is probably bottom 5 in the league. Judge and Volpe's injuries add to that too. But they have tons of veterans that should be great defenders and just aren't.",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ntneoc/eddie_murray_baseball_hasnt_changed_for_the_best/nguz3rq/,2025-09-29T17:18:14+00:00,Yankees,1087
reddit_comment,orioles,CrackityJones79,"Love Eddie, but not sure I agree with a lot of that. Outfielders have huge, accurate arms these days. Most infielders make plays that were almost unheard of in the 80’s. Defense is great. Athleticism is off the charts.

reddit_comment,orioles,_bluecrab_,"Eddie could be 100% correct, that not enough emphasis is put on fielding practice these days... but I could also see him being an old man not realizing how things have changed. It very well could be that they're doing the same or more practice at times other than right before a game, and that the conventional wisdom has evolved that doing it right before a game isn't as efficient, more risky, etc. I work in a field where we're having to research government regulations from time to time. We have an old guy that should have retired years ago, and in between meetings he was complaining that the young staff doesn't take the time to look up regs anymore. I asked him why he felt that was true and his smoking gun was that not a single youngster had the six-volume paper bound copy of the regs on their desk or bookshelf, like they did in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and early 00s. He could not be convinced that having a digital copy that could be searched in seconds was better than the old days.",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ntneoc/eddie_murray_baseball_hasnt_changed_for_the_best/ngvclpm/,2025-09-29T18:21:53+00:00,Yankees,991
reddit_comment,orioles,WhyNotOrioles,"That kind of thing isn't the most important factor in baseball, but it definitely matters in the edges. The perfect example was the World Series last year, between a team that knew its fundamentals (Dodgers) and a team that didn't (Yankees). Some of the games were decided by short hop throws from the outfield being mishandled by the infield. It all would have been moot if the Yankees had hit just a little better, but the teams were close enough for it to matter, and it did.",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ntneoc/eddie_murray_baseball_hasnt_changed_for_the_best/nh2g7ij/,2025-09-30T20:12:53+00:00,Yankees,478

We're talking about practice. I know I'm supposed to be there, I know I'm supposed to lead by example, I know that. And I'm not shoving it aside like it don't mean anything. I know it's important. I do. I honestly do. But we're talking about practice, man. What are we talking about? Practice? We're talking about practice, man! >We're talking about practice! We're talking about practice...

reddit_comment,orioles,Warm_Garden_8528,I kind of get where he is coming from. Those guys took fielding practice almost everyday to compete at a high level and win.

reddit_comment,orioles,wompwump,"Rough, if predictable, outcome. On the positive side: don’t look now, but Coby Mayo is oh-so-close to having league-average offensive production: he now has a 97 wRC+. I’m still only cautiously optimistic (he finally got to league average in late July…and then the downslope came), but it’s a positive sign in this year of development. At this point, I assume Mounty is gone, either a low-return trade or straight up non-tender. He’ll probably cost $8M+, so I’d frame it as: would you rather have Mounty, or a Kittredge-esque reliever?

reddit_comment,orioles,Loose_Log_6253,"Tough loss but if Rogers goes this year with only one bad start, that's still an amazing season. I bet he's exhausted, it sounds like he's been putting in work all season long. I hope he doesn't beat himself up over it. Meanwhile, in the rest of the league, I see that both Cleveland and the Guardians lost, but the Astros are winning. Does that increase the odds the Tigers miss the playoffs? Also, we lost but so did TBR, and we do have the season series over TBR. If we can win our next two games and they lose their next two, we technically finish above them. Very unlikely but I can dream on one last bit of Orioles Magic.",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1nrjd7x/post_game_thread_the_orioles_fell_to_the_yankees/ngf6vew/,2025-09-27T03:20:23+00:00,Yankees,627

reddit_post,orioles,TadpoleAngel,"A subjective ranking of the 2025 Orioles 40-man roster by my wife! Welcome to the fourth glorious, borderline-unnecessary installment of the subjective Baltimore Orioles roster rankings, painstakingly assembled by a 30-something-year-old mother of two who really should have better things to do. Loyal readers may recall the breakthroughs of [2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/xt7idp/a_subjective_ranking_of_the_2022_orioles_40man/), the innovations of [2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/s/tGnL5mWncM), and the chaos of [2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ftoo9w/a_subjective_ranking_of_the_2024_orioles_40man/)—each year marking another step in my wife’s transformation from curious Baby Bird to full-on r/orioles lifer, mainlining roster photos like they’re sunflower seeds. The method remains unchanged, because why mess with perfection? Each player is subjected to a rigorous photo-review session, judged on a scale of 1–10 for charm, charisma, and how well they project either *boy-next-door energy* or *suspiciously fatherly vibes*. Additional points may be awarded for personal encounters at Orioles Selfie Day, where hand softness and general huggability are taken very seriously. What follows are her deeply unscientific, wholly subjective, and entirely entertaining rankings, complete with her unfiltered thoughts, faithfully transcribed by me, your humble scribe and co-conspirator. Go O's! **The 2025 Orioles 40-man Roster According to my Wife** **Gunnar Henderson - 10:** Gunnar's just so... smoking hot. I love him. I wish we could sign him forever. I think he is just... I don't have words for it. He is incredibly attractive. The way he exudes... himself. His demeanor. His serious look. But he's so genuine and friendly and down to earth. **Adley Rutschman - 9:** I mean... obviously a 9. Adley is really nice, super cute. He completes me... and the team. If Adley left, it would be apocalyptic. He has it all: the looks, the vibes, and he's a good person. I just need someone to inspire me, and it's Adley. **Jordan Westburg - 8:** I like my westie. He's the bestie. I was sad when he was injured. He's super nice and very cute. And he's only 26? He's great. One of my favorites. **Dean Kremer - 8:** He's a beautiful human. Probably one of the most beautiful. In person, he feels a little distant... probably because he's so beautiful. It's not his fault, he's just pretty. **Kyle Bradish - 8:** He's probably one of my favorite pitchers. He seems kind of badass. Super cool... cool little man, cool, cool little man. **Colton Cowser - 8:** He's cute. He's really good. Cowser brings all the cows to the yard. He's just a great person to have on the team. He has great vibes, and the team is so much better when he's around. That's great for morale. **Zach Eflin - 7:** Zach! He's very good looking. A very nice guy. Super-duper nice. Charismatic. He has a lot of kids. He's a good dad. Was he good this season? **Cade Povich - 7:** Oh, he's cute. He seems like he's really young. I think he's good. **Felix Bautista - 7:** Aww. I give him a 7. He's our gentle giant. He's so active on Instagram. I've met him in person a bunch of times and he's always so gentle with his handshakes. He didn't want to hurt me. **Tyler Wells - 7:** He's not bad looking, and he's not a rando. He's one of our better pitchers? Oh wow, he's 31? He looks so young. **Samuel Basallo - 7**: He has a lot of potential. He reminds me of a young Santander. He's a good looking kid. It's exciting that we signed him! Why don't we sign Gunnar? It's nice we'll have him for a long time, so we can see him blossom into a hotter person. **Jackson Holliday - 7**: He's the best of the Jackson's. He gets more attractive the more you look at him. His demeanor is similar to Gunnar's. Jackson is integral to our team. And he's nice in real life. **Jorge Mateo - 7:** I always think Jorge has been traded, but then there he is. He's nice. He's an OG. **Coby Mayo - 7:** I like Coby. He's tall and cute. He's a good guy to have on our team, I think. **Ryan Mountcastle - 7:** RyRy! We like our RyRy. He's so funny. He's sneaky fast. He's an OG. We like him. He's cute. **Heston Kjerstad - 7:** \[laughs\] This photo is really not good. But you know what? I love him. I love when he told Volpe to shut the fuck up. I want him back on our team. **Grant Wolfram - 6:** I don't know him, but he's actually pretty good looking. **Tomoyuki Sugano - 6:** Sugano signed a baseball for us! That was nice of him. I don't have much to say. He's... not that good. I had high hopes, but...he's nice. His face is nice. **Jeremiah Jackson - 6:** I actually know his face. He's the skinniest Jackson. I think he's doing well? **Dylan Beavers - 6:** Beavers... hehe. He has a very interesting look. Very old timey. **Yennier Cano - 6:** Cano is a 6. He'd be higher if he was better. I don't think he's that good anymore. His face doesn't spark a lot of joy for me. **Albert Suarez - 6:** I don't feel strongly about him, even though I've met him. I guess he's nice. Big ""Papa Bear"" energy. **Grayson Rodriguez - 6:** People always get mad when I rank him low... so he gets a 6. He's fine. He's not my type. He's been injured this whole time? Come on - contribute. **Trevor Rogers - 6:** He's our MVP. So... good for him. **Tyler O'Neil - 6:** He's not my type. I guess he's not bad? **Rico Garcia - 5:** He actually looks really nice. Warm. With a good laugh. **Jose Espada - 5:** This man doesn't exist. I don't believe it. This is a random person wearing an Orioles hat. He's kind of cute, I guess. **Ryan Noda - 5:** Nooooo... da. He looks friendly. He looks like he could be a hobbit. Not because he's short but because of his face. **Brandon Young - 5:** Wow that hair. His hair is distracting. He looks jolly. He gets a 5 for his great locks. **Maverick Handley - 5:** If you squint, he looks almost like that guy who had cancer (Trey Mancini 🥺). Don't write that. He looks nice. **Daniel Johnson - 5:** I don't know him. Is he a catcher? His eyes sparkle, I guess. **Alex Jackson - 5:** He's one of the Jackson's. That's what he looks like? Whatever. **Colin Selby - 5:** Wait, I've seen him already (she thinks this is also Shawn Dubin). That makes me angry. I guess he's not bad looking. **Keegan Akin - 5:** I dunno. At the moment his face doesn't make me mad. He's got a jolly face. I need more coffee. **Dietrich Enns - 5:** I don't like the pitchers. I guess he looks like a good guy? But looking at him right now makes me angry. **Dylan Carlson - 5:** I have no personal connection to this person. He is a rando. He's not a pitcher? Every time I hear his name, I feel like dancing the Carlson. **Josh Walker - 4:** I have nothing to say about him. I guess his eyes are pretty, but I don't like that jawline. just personal preference. **Jose Castillo - 4:** I've never seen this man in my entire life. I give him a 4 for being a rando. Wait, his nickname is ""big dude?!"" That's nice. **Chayce McDermott - 4:** I think I've met him. I'm not a fan of his goatee. **Carson Ragsdale - 4:** I don't want to rank him. He looks stern. He looks like a coach. I guess he's not bad looking, but he makes me uncomfortable. **Shawn Dubin - 3:** Dubin? What's a Dubin? Who is this person? Sigh. He's got a great big bushy beard. **Yaramil Hiraldo - 3:** \[laughs\] What happened to his cheekbones? Who is this?? **Kade Strowd - 3:** Who is he? Strowd? That mustache? I have nothing to say about him. The end. **Gary Sanchez - 3:** He's a backup catcher? He was a Yankee? For that he gets a 3. **Luis Vazquez - 2:** I don't like the soul patch. **Bonus Rankings!** **Cedric Mullins - 10:** \[cries\] I love him so much. I can't believe he's not on our team. What a tough loss. I've never experienced pain like that. Ceddy... was the team. He felt like our captain, he with us through the good and the bad. He delivered when we needed him. And the stupid Mets didn't even make it to be post season. **Anthony Santander - 9:** \[sobs\] Man oh Manischewitz. He was my first Orioles love. It's hard to replace him. He was just... such a MAN **Melanie Newman - 8:** Hot. She's beautiful and has a great smile. Whenever we lose, she does the post-game, and I feel better. **Brandon Quinones - 8:** Brandon is super cute. I met him! We look good together. He's very friendly. I'm glad he's still with us, even though Tony left. **Kevin Brown - 7:** I really like Kevin Brown. He's the perfect combination of funny and cute. Perfect voice. Perfect vibes. Please don't leave us, Kevin. **Mike Elias - 7:** Oh. Haha. I say this every year... but he looks like a rich white man. maybe it's the haircut. I guess he's attractive. he almost hit us with his car once when we were leaving the park. He looked so sad. **Brandon Hyde - 7:** Noooo I liked him. The team doesn't feel the same without him. I don't really think it was his fault, but I guess he has to take the blame. **Ryan O'Hearn - 7:** He's just such a great guy. He was so good and it sucked to lose him. This is making me sad. **Brett Hollander - 6:** Oh, he's pretty nice. Baby face man. I've met him a few times. I feel like he's my friend. Can I give a friend a 6? **Ben McDonald - 6:** I like him. There's something calming about his voice. He makes you think that everything will be okay. **Ramon Urias - 6:** Aww. I liked Ramon. What a sad, sad year. **Tony Mansolino - 6:** I don't know him well. Has he been good? At the start he looked like a deer in headlights. He still does kind of. **Jim Palmer - 5:** Not my type. **Takeaways** It’s safe to say that in 2025, Gunnar and Adley remain the sun and moon of my wife's Orioles universe: one smoldering, one soul-completing. Westburg, Kremer, and Cowser make up the core of the “cute-and-dependable” tier, while Kyle Bradish has cemented himself as the *cool little man* of her heart. The middle ranks are a mix of “gentle giants,” “nice dads,” and “rando Jacksons,” proving once again that being tall, approachable, or accidentally looking like a hobbit will reliably earn you a 6 or 7. Meanwhile, Grayson Rodriguez continues his eternal struggle against her indifference, destined to live in the “fine but not my type” zone no matter how many strikeouts he throws. And of course, the bonus rankings remind us that the real heartbreak isn’t in the bottom of the list. It’s in the empty spots on the roster where Cedric and Santander used to be. Reader beware: these rankings double as a love letter and a therapy session.",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1nup9a5/a_subjective_ranking_of_the_2025_orioles_40man/,2025-09-30T21:05:57+00:00,Mets,10529

reddit_post,orioles,FurryUnicorn,"Would you like Padres CL Robert Suarez as the next Os closer? At age 34 he’s the 100 mph power closer who finished leading the NL with 40 saves. His Padres deal is 46M for 5 years, with two years remaining at 8M/YR. According to the article he’s estimated to make twice that now. (Other caveats, he’s the little brother of Albert Suarez. Perhaps that may give the Orioles a subtle edge to give him the special opportunity to play with his brother? I’m sure it wouldn’t amount to any significant discount, just a neat factoid) How much do you think it would take?

reddit_post,orioles,TechnicalLeave6989,"Four Pennants, Two Rings: The Baltimore Orioles’ Golden Era of Dominance The 1960s and early 1970s marked an unforgettable chapter in baseball history as the Baltimore Orioles dominated the American League. Fueled by the legendary Frank Robinson, the Orioles captured four pennants and two World Series titles during this golden era. Robinson’s leadership on and off the field set the tone for a franchise that would reign supreme for nearly a decade. This article examines how Robinson, alongside an elite pitching staff and a blend of key players, helped the Orioles achieve sustained success.

reddit_comment,orioles,wompwump,"The real standout of this podcast: Mike Elias shows some personality and tells a joke! Otherwise, not a ton of new information, although he did elaborate on topics he covered in less detail in his end-of-season presser. On FA pitching philosophy / not signing pitchers to multi-year deals: > “we have made offers to sign pitchers for multi-year deals, so it's not a real fair reflection of our total philosophy. A lot of those offers have frankly been kind of reported on publicly. But it's true that that hasn't come to fruition yet. I can't imagine that lasts too much longer. I can't make any promises or guarantees in my position. But that's certainly not a hard and fast philosophy of ours.” On Mayo: > “And I think Mayo is a good example of somebody whose initial transition understandably took some time as a 6'5, power hitting, right handed hitter who was very, very young. But we saw some really good progress toward the end of 2025 and hope and every confidence that's going to roll over to next year and beyond in his career.” On the catching situation: > “So plenty of room for both of those guys [Adley and Basallo]. I even think we may look at a situation next year, you know, with the 13 man position player roster, that we carry a third catcher could happen from time to time. So both of these guys, having them in the lineup is important” On packaging O’Hearn and Laureano to get Boston Bateman: >”Whether or not we were going to trade Laureano was something that we were doing around the market. The Padres indicated that if we were to combine those guys [O’Hearn and Laureano], they would put together a strong package, but also that they would include Boston Bateman, a left handed pitcher in the deal who was off to a really good start. And our scouts loved from a SoCal high school in the 2024 draft and doing really well at Lake Elsinore with the Padres. So for us, that made it worth it to start building a package”",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1nvfgoq/mlbtr_podcast_mike_elias_on_the_state_of_the/nh87cmo/,2025-10-01T18:14:20+00:00,Orioles,1939

That's not a dig at Elias because no person is all-knowing and skilled in every single facet of a job. We all have strengths. We all have weaknesses. And when you build a team of complimentary skill sets, you end up with a much stronger organization overall (especially if you have a leader who understands how to best deploy different individuals with different skill sets). This is an opportunity to do just that, and I'm hopeful they find the right person that helps makes this a more capable organization in the future. It also sounds like Elias understands/acknowledges some of the issues that impacted the team over the past year and a half.

reddit_post,orioles,Playful_Singer_3399,Favorite Orioles player from this 2025 season Who was your favorite Orioles player you’ve watched this 2025 season? Mine is Adley Rutschman. He is a very talented catcher and he seemed to improve his batting skills after returning from the IL list. He seems so kind and genuine as well. I love watching his Adley hugs to the pitcher at the end of the games. I missed him when he was on the IL list twice. He makes all the games worth watching for me.

Two other managers that have been dismissed this season/post-season with success are Bob Melvin (former Orioles catcher and WS winning manager) and Bud Black. Of course, Colorado did him a favor by firing him. You can’t put a minor league team on the field against major leaguers. Bruce Bochy would be a good choice, but he is 70 years old. Not to be ageist, but would that be an issue when your core players are in their 20s? Maybe not the best fit. I’d say Buck Britton but it’s the wrong time.

When a guy slumps is it just a regular slump or is he sick, injured, personal issue, etc. Cedric Mullins disclosed his intestinal issue a year ago and things like that can weaken you or make it hard to perform at top ability. I always wondered about Olympic athletes who spend 4 years trying to get to their event and win a gold medal. How many of them end up with injuries or just being ill and not 100%. People will say you have to power through but your body can only do so much. Imagine trying to compete with food poisoning or something similar. No way you can be close to 100%. Heston seems to have some issues. Physically, mentally, who knows unless he says what it is and that assumes they can diagnose it. While his OF play is not good, he has shown at times to be a solid hitter and put up some decent numbers in the past.

reddit_post,orioles,sippysipster,2088 At the beginning of the season I decided I would do 2 pushups for every run the Orioles won a game by and 4 pushups for every run they lost a game by 5 pushups per inning if it went to extras. If my math is correct I ended the season with 2088 pushups. That being said 88 pushups on Easter when we lost by 22 almost made me quit but we stuck it out See you next season 🫡,https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1nt5731/2088/,2025-09-29T01:18:16+00:00,Orioles,375

reddit_post,orioles,ScoutNWilder,"Something to do during the long Orioles offseason Hello fellow Birdlanders. I've been an avid contributor to the Orioles sub for the last several years. I am not looking forward to the offseason. With the mods' permission, I am posting about a little side project I've recently launched that might help get you through. [The Winfield Game](https://www.winfieldgame.com/) is a daily online sports game that challenges you to figure out that day's Answer Player in as few guesses as possible. The Answer Players will always be All Stars or Pro Bowlers from the NBA, MLB, and NFL (just offensive players for now). To start, you guess a player, any player. As you guess players, various matches will show. Hence, there is a lot of strategy around who you use as a starting player. Orioles legends Rich Hill and Edwin Jackson have become popular. Green circle matches mean the player played their most games in the city, for the team, at that position, etc. I'd love for the sub to play and share your results - the share button when you finish gives you non-spoiler text. And as I've just now launched beyond friends and family, I'd appreciate any help in getting the word out to your fantasy football leagues or anyone else you think might be interested. Today should be an easy one for this group, but I encourage you to play games in the archive (top right calendar button) - some of them have been very tough! Thank you very much! Oh, and FTY...especially Stanton.

reddit_comment,orioles,BirdlandDeadhead,"Cool concept, but I gotta say this was a very confusing format. I’ll avoid spoilers for now but there was a lot of inconsistency in what popped up, whether circled or uncircled, for each guess. Sometimes it brought up awards they’d won, sometimes it didn’t. Sometimes it only brought up the team/decade/position they were most associated with, sometimes it brought up multiple decades or positions, sometimes it brought up no team at all. Just all around kinda confusing. I do really like the concept though, just think it would be simpler to drop any “they played the most games for X team or in Y decade or at Z position” and just bring up *any* characteristics that match.",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1nrlocq/something_to_do_during_the_long_orioles_offseason/ngffpr8/,2025-09-27T04:27:13+00:00,Orioles,675

For sure. But to go public, yeah, it didn't sit well with me. Honestly, it made me sad for the sport that that's how this all got found out. This wasn't something MLB naturally investigated or that even other teams complained about because they naturally heard about it and investigations happened. But it came from within. It was a player that was a part of it, that benefited from it during the regular season when he was a part of that team. That, when I first heard about it, it hits you like any teammate would. It's something that you don't do. I totally get telling your future teammates, helping them win, letting people know, but to go public with it and call them out and start all of this, it's hard to swallow.

reddit_comment,orioles,pan567,"I don't think 'disappointment' is necessarily the right term, but Kjerstad and Bautista were by and far the hardest gut punches and the most upsetting parts of the season because it goes way beyond just the game. We're talking baseball here, and we love to watch and discuss the team, but both of these guys are dealing with very serious issues that could have the potential to be not only career ending, but life altering from a health perspective. Felix came back from a very significant injury with healing complications only to go down a few months later with two much more serious injuries than the first. Heston made it through myocarditis only to suffer a wicked head injury, and that sort of injury can have long-term (and even lifelong) consequences. This is their lives we are talking about and they are both facing an incredible level of uncertainty and I can only imagine that it must be incredibly psychologically distressing (in addition to a likely physically distressing recovery aspect).",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ntqh1v/biggest_player_disappointmentspositives_of_the/ngwfsvw/,2025-09-29T21:31:25+00:00,A's,1004
reddit_comment,orioles,SaturnATX,"Disappointments: Jackson Holliday Holliday slugged .375 and was worth 1.0 WAR in 650 Plate Appearances. The average 2B in MLB this year was worth around 2.0 WAR, meaning he is barely playing well enough to be considered a starter. While he did improve in the second half (his walk rate was 37 walks per 650 plate appearances before the ASB, it was 85 per 650 plate appearances after, K rate went from 25% in the first half to 17% in the second) the awful defense and complete lack of pop in the bat are extremely concerning. He needs to get better at almost everything - seeing the ball better, hitting for power, baserunning, fielding, turning the double play - if he's going to be a long term star.

reddit_comment,orioles,d84doc,"Disappointment for me is Gunnar. He wasn’t terrible across the board but the first half of last season he was in the MVP talk, so the fact he was so non-existent is tough, but the bigger issue for me is his clear avoidance of being a leader. He said as much on a podcast, and that’s a tough thing to hear from a player on a team that is in need of leaders. I don’t believe being a leader comes naturally to everyone or that it is easy, but it says a lot more to me when a guy makes no effort to be the kind of guy a clubhouse needs. Positive, Trevor Rogers. Before the season I was so unhappy with our rotation and he was a big reason, and it had NOTHING to do with Stowers doing well. That being said, Rogers deserves his flowers 100%! Second option for disappointment is Mike Elias and Rubenstein. We finished last place and somehow it was more the manager’s fault than the GM, that’s been here for 7 years, not signed a single significant FA, and has 0 playoff wins to show for it. He also has a history of talking about spending money and then not following through, and save me on anyone claiming we had one of the biggest increases in payroll from last season to this season, that happens when you hand out 1 year $15 mil deals. I hate to say it, but I’m starting to worry Rubenstein is an all talk owner but has no real interest in spending when the window is open. He also saw the state the team was put in my Elias and decided, I’ll reward him with a promotion, but we won’t actually announce it. Things are being run right in the warehouse.",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ntqh1v/biggest_player_disappointmentspositives_of_the/ngwv2dq/,2025-09-29T22:54:47+00:00,A's,1550

reddit_comment,orioles,Positive_League_5534,"Positives: 1. Trevor Rogers - If he can keep his control, he'll be a solid #2 and great #3. His velocity faded near the end of the season, but it was never that great (with the Orioles) to begin with. 2. Kyle Bradish - It was almost like he never went on the IL. Hopefully, he can continue to improve and stay healthy. 3. Dean Kremer - This guy has proven himself as a very solid back of the rotation workhorse. Yes, he got off to a slow start, but he is proving himself to be a reliable inning eater. 4. Jackson Holliday - While certainly not playing up to his hype, Jackson put together a solid season improving both defensively and at the plate. I'm not sure if we'll ever get Bobby Witt, Jr. numbers out of him, but he could be our 2B for many seasons and at 22 has significant upside. I was disappointed in the play of Gunnar, Westburg, O'Neill, Rutschman, and Cowser. All of them suffered injuries that may have lingered, but they've got something to prove in 2026. I'm looking forward to seeing Beavers, Basallo, J Jackson, and Mayo continue to improve. What do we need: 1. Top of the rotation starter. Doesn't have to be an ace, but someone to give us a solid season. That could be Grayson Rodriguez. 2. Closer - Sadly, the Mountain won't pitch in 2026 and with the types of injuries he suffered he may never be the same. I didn't see anyone capable of being that guy in '25. I do believe Elias and team has done a decent job of finding bullpen guys. 3. All-Star caliber Outfielder - preferably CF. Cowser took a step back offensively, and O'Neill is a question mark. Our offense was 24th in the bigs at producing runs...that's not going to do it. We have to get more production out of the outfield. Beavers and Cowser/O'Neill need someone else to give us that 30 HR/100 RBI type of season while also playing solid defense. 4. Mountcastle, Westburg, Rutschman, Cowser, Rodriguez, O'Neill, need to prove they can stay on the field and productive for at least 130 games. It's likely that Mountie will be traded in the off season, but if the right deal isn't offered, he could be a solid member of the '26 squad. 5. Mayo, Beavers, Basallo, J Jackson need to show they can make the adjustments necessary to be successful in the big leagues. 6. I should have put this at the top... We need a veteran player (not pitcher) that can teach these guys what is necessary to win in the major leagues. Someone that is productive both on the field and in the clubhouse. This could be the outfielder I mentioned above.",https://reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1ntqh1v/biggest_player_disappointmentspositives_of_the/ngzptn7/,2025-09-30T11:53:13+00:00,A's,2511

reddit_comment,phillies,Robokiller87,"Decided to look into the nitty gritty of the Reds and Dodgers season. While we still need to beat everyone who comes to our doorstep it'll be nice to know who is the actual threat from these two teams depending on who makes it. Most people off the rip would probably think Dodgers and I would think so too. Aside from them being the defending champs the roster is littered with MVPs and overall talent but Im just typing this out as I look deeper into the numbers. **REDS** (83-79) Most productive player: Elly De La Cruz. Following are team stats he's #1 in: Games played (162), Runs (102), Hits (166), 2B (31), 3B (7), HR (22), RBI (86), SB (37), CS (8), SO (181). Most productive pitcher: Andrew Abbott. Hunter Greene has a good case but he has 60 less IP. Also the pitcher stats are very inconsistent on this team and more annoying to qualify than not. Notable splits and other facts \- Finished Sept. at 14-11 good for the 2nd best month record wise. The 2nd half of the season was worse than the 1st for them. \~.500 team in 1 run games or blowout games. They've had 20 games where they've lost by 5 and 22 games where they've won by 5 runs. Horrendous extra inning team (3-12). **The largest deficit they've overcame this season is a 3 run lead** **and largest lead they've blown is a 7 run lead.** \- Team slash line in the last 30 days: .237/.305/.398. BAbip of .286 (league average is .291). \- Significantly better slash line vs. RHP by a difference of 20 OPS+. \- Struggles mightily against LH relievers. \- Out of all the months played, Sept is the worst offensively. \- As a team they typically take the first pitch (70% of the time) and overall produce worse results due to that. Above league average as a team with RISP, but they are very league average when it comes to high leverage situations. They cannot hit with RISP with 2 outs and are otherwise unfazed in their overall performance whether they're up or down or even tied. They'll play just as hard up 5 runs as they're down 5 runs. \- Top heavy lineup \- They decimate pitchers who don't rely on speed in their pitching and struggle against power pitching \- The absolute *worst opponent* for the Reds to face are the Dodgers. The Reds have a 64 OPS+ against them with a .274 BAbip leaving only the Giants are arguably worse to face for the Reds. They have a 42 OPS+ .269 BAbip in Dodgers stadium. Their LH bats overall have a 22 OPS+ .130 BAbip in Dodgers stadium whereas RH bats sit at 49 OPS+ .244 BAbip. \- Reds pitching as a whole has been worse than their season averages in the last 30 days. \- Sept. was their 2nd worst month for pitching. \- Relievers are wildly effective and just as good as their rotation who don't allow as many baserunners. \- Pitching staff is league average dealing with RISP and in any leverage type situation. \- This pitching staff would categorize the Dodgers as their 9th toughest team to face based on OPS+ and BAbip sitting at 123 and .333. Additionally playing at Dodgers stadium has that location as the 5th toughest they've pitched in with a OPS+ of 144 and .304 BAbip. The overall numbers from the pitching staff in their prior 3 game set at Dodgers stadium is this: 0-3, 6 ERA, 1.58 WHIP, allowed 5 HRs 26 Hits 12 BBs and 23 Ks in 24 IP. \- The Reds LHP at Dodgers stadium struggles significantly more compared to RHP. 162 OPS+ .348 BAbip compared to 135 OPS+ and .283 BAbip. \- They have no good game calling catchers, all of the have the same type of stats with the pitching staff. Frankly all of this seems horrendous for the Reds and I'll do a same look into the Dodgers. Posted that in a reply and the Dodgers are not a perfect team by any stretch of the imagination even with all of their talent. I just don't see the Reds as the team to beat them.",https://reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/1nu86du/phillies_off_day_thread_tuesday_september_30/nh0kbvy/,2025-09-30T14:45:07+00:00,NYY,3773

reddit_post,phillies,Ok-Mess5196,"Do you guys think the Phillies could land Pete Alonso since he is opting out of his contract? The 2025 regular season is over. The Mets have just missed the playoffs (YIPEEEEEEEE!!!!) and Alonso himself said that he is opting out of his contract. Based on how he has been during 2025, do you think the Phillies should and could try to sign him now that he is a free agent? Now, I understand if you guys might be wanting to ask me ""But what about Harper? He is also a first baseman and so is Alonso!"" Well, here is my idea. 1. The Phillies should start off by offering Alonso a good contract. 2. If Alonso goes forward and signs with the Phillies, they should then trade Nick Castellanos for money. He did not have a good 2025 regular season, and he doesn't really seem like he is that happy with being on the Phillies. 3. Have Alonso be the new 1st baseman, and move Harper to RF. Bryce Harper has played in outfield earlier in his career, and he has said himself that he would be willing to play another position to acquire a good 1st baseman like Alonso. Now, I DEFINITELY would not say that the Phillies should sign Schwarber after Alonso. I still think that when their postseason ends, their main focus should be on Kyle Schwarber. And then, if that goes well, they can look into acquiring Pete Alonso. So what do y'all think? In my opinion, if the Phillies were to acquire Alonso, that would SIGNIFICANTLY boost our offense. He had 38 home runs in 2025, and frankly, as long as he is happy to be there, he would make a great addition. It could take some time for Harper to get used to being an outfielder again, but the offense would go NUTS if we signed Alonso.",https://reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/1nvesx9/do_you_guys_think_the_phillies_could_land_pete/,2025-10-01T17:35:23+00:00,Mets,1667

Losing Alvarado, and then Wheeler. But somehow this team scrapped through it and are, dare I even say it, *still lethal.* It’d be foolish to say we are better without them, because we aren’t.

reddit_comment,phillies,I_Ran_So_Far_Away1,Ok follow me on this one. We have to root for the Mets today if we want the one seed. If the Mets lose and the Reds win the Mets season is over today and the Reds clinch a playoff spot. That means Cincinnati will rest all of their guys tomorrow against the brewers and the brewers can walk to the 1 seed. If the Mets win today regardless of what Cincinnati does it comes down to tomorrow and cinci plays for the playoffs. Of course we have to sweep but we have Ranger and Sanchez.

reddit_post,phillies,TechnicalLeave6989,"The 2008 World Series Triumph Of The Phillies The 2008 World Series was more than just a championship for the Philadelphia Phillies-it was a redemption arc. Their 1993 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in six games was a painful memory that lingered for 15 years. The Phillies’ return to the Fall Classic in 2008 wasn’t just a chance to win; it was their moment to finally rewrite that painful history. With a mix of power, pitching, and perseverance, the 2008 Phillies claimed their first World Series title since 1980, overcoming both the ghosts of their past and the fierce competition from the Tampa Bay Rays. From the outset of the season, the Phillies were determined to prove they belonged. With veterans like Ryan Howard, Chase Utley, and Jimmy Rollins leading the charge, and ace pitchers like Cole Hamels and Brad Lidge anchoring the staff, the Phillies were more than just a talented squad-they were a team on a mission. Their journey to the 2008 World Series wasn’t just about what happened on the field; it was about fulfilling a destiny that had been waiting for them since their 1993 defeat.

At the end of Sept 1993 my family packed up from just outside Toronto and moved to just outside Philadelphia because my father was transferred to the Dupont headquarters in Delaware.

I wanted to share a story I wrote this week about Kyle Schwarber’s work ethic in the batting cage. I love talking to players about anything and everything behind the scenes, especially something like Schwarber’s mindset in how he approaches his work day. I saw Schwarber enter the clubhouse late on Saturday night -- it was obvious he was coming back from the cage -- which sparked the idea for the story. I liked what Kevin Long and some of his teammates had to say about Schwarber, too. I'd love to hear your thoughts. And if you have any questions about the story, post them here!

Every season ticket package sold signals to the Phillies organization that ticket prices can be higher, as we've seen. If you aren't buying the season ticket package for the value of those tickets themselves but instead speculating on a return you might get on post-season resells...

reddit_post,phillies,shouldhavekeptgiles,"For the Phillies their best is good enough It’s going to be Phillies dodgers. From the moment the format was announced we all really knew it would be. (Sorry Reds) Am I worried? No. The dodgers are easily still one of the best teams in baseball and have been white hot down the stretch. They have the first or second best player in baseball. They have a lineup full of big time performers and recognizable names. In the words from the Ultravox song Vienna, “this means nothing to me”. And it shouldn’t to you either. And I guarantee you the Phillies do not care. The Phillies best is good enough. You still have in my opinion what is the best pitching staff in baseball. You have a bullpen that went from very good to elite in the back end after the deadline. You have a defense that if you remove Castellanos is one of the better defenses in baseball. The hitting and specifically the power have come fully alive in the second half. The time is now. This is likely this specific cores last ride before losing players I love like Schwarber and/or Suarez. The Phillies have convincingly beat the dodgers since 2022. Dodger stadium does not scare me in the fucking slightest like Citi Field or whatever the fuck that hellhole in Arizona is called. As a pretty vocal split city fan, of my favorite quotes from Bill Cowher is “your best is good enough” during their miraculous 2005 run to the Super Bowl. Well the Phillies best is good enough and they don’t need more than their best. The dodgers are in the way, we are going to get them out of the way and go to the next round. Jinxes aren’t real so I’m going to say it right now, Phillies in 4. it’s not going to be a close 4, it’s going to be like the 2022 NLDS BTA treatment the Phillies gave the Braves. Beat. LA. Let’s.

reddit_post,phillies,helpslipnofranklins,"Predicting Schwarbers contract based on Spotrac comparisons The group of comparable players doesn't really feel like the best group to go off. Semien Springer and freeman were all signed 3+ years ago and market values around the league have gone up since. Looking at the deal Chapman signed last offseason gives a better idea of what we can expect. Schwarber had a significantly better contract year than Chapman did last year. It seems like the Phillies may want to avoid going beyond a 4 or 5 year deal which will raise the AAV. Looking at the list of salaries for DH's on slide two, the expectation should be Schwarber will be made the highest paid DH (excluding Ohtani) My guess for what the Phillies offer Kyle is a 4 year/ 130 million with an AAV of 32.5 with a mutual option for a 5th year with a couple million dollar buyout. Hopefully he will be willing have a large chunk of the contract deferred to lower the hit on the teams CBT.",https://reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/1nv01u3/predicting_schwarbers_contract_based_on_spotrac/,2025-10-01T05:37:48+00:00,Phillies,941

reddit_comment,phillies,Ironstark12,"He’s not getting a deal longer then 5. Probably 4. If he wants to maximize the dollar amount, it’ll be 4 years 110-130 million range. No team is going to pay him over 30(maybe 31,32 tops) a year. That higher numbers were thrown out there but all the writers said it’s a pipe dream. He won’t have a huge market. Yes a lot of teams would want him but once you cross out those that can’t afford him and those that can but don’t need him, (Dodgers,Yankees are examples) it really is 2-4 teams. I’m hearing one of the things the league wants to change in the bargaining agreement in 27 is deferred payments. The Dodgers love it but most clubs feel they are at a disadvantage already and if they can defer money it’s worse. They want a cap( a very small % can be deferred.) That’s it. So I’m guessing any deals signed this offseason won’t be many deferred deals.

I am a host on the WIP Afternoon Show with Ike Reese and Jack Fritz. I also have been hosting The Rights To Ricky Sanchez for 12 years now. I will check-in throughout the day to answer questions as best I can, but the time when I will really dig in is when I get home from work tonight at 7pm EST. And before the first question is ""why do YOU think anyone wants to ask you a question,"" an r/phillies mod asked me to! So don't blame me, blame him. One funny side-note is that I once had to help Mick Foley did an AMA. I helped work on a documentary about Santa Claus called I Am Santa Claus in 2014 that Mick starred in and was an executive producer. He agreed to do an AMA to help promote, and I said I'd get him set up. He sat down and informed me there was no way he could type all of that, so he sat in my office and I asked him the questions aloud and I transcribed on to the AMA. **EDIT: THANK YOU!** I will check in tomorrow morning to see if anything was missed. If you are so inclined, two worthy causes: **BARK IN THE PARK:** Every year we have a big team for Rights To Ricky that participates in this fundraiser for the Providence Animal Center.

Last summer, Helen, a math teacher, suffered an aneurysm at 32 years old. She's been in inpatient rehab for a year, trying to get her life back. Her right arm and leg are paralyzed, and while she can understand when people speak to her, she has trouble responding. She's coming home soon, and her husband Steve wants her to continue therapy at home, but a year of it costs around $65,000.

Situation is I work 6 days a week and currently will only catch one game of the NLDS even if it ends up being the Dodgers in the prime time night slot. I have comcast xfinity and set it to record the Phillies (like the actual sports team not any specific channel, this is important) I’ve watched every game I could that way and caught like 145 of them after work. I do outlandish things to avoid spoilers. The problem: I have to watch on my pc as my tv is unavailable during those times, and when my recording has recorded TBS instead of the local Philly sports channel it says I can’t watch it because of contractual restrictions or some shit. Of course the postseason is on tbs or at least the NLDS is. I’m worried if I try to record the actual tbs channel, that it will record too much after the game that the game recording will get deleted before I can watch because there’s very little space. What is the best way or subscription I can get to guarantee I can record and watch the games on my pc? MLB TV doesn’t have recording options. Any help would be greatly appreciated and sorry for the lengthy post. I have been waiting for this since last October and I am having physical stress over this and want to be prepared lol.

reddit_comment,phillies,problyurdad_,"This looks pretty damned good overall. Can’t say I disagree, although I wouldn’t be shocked if the Reds caught the Dodgers off guard and pull out at least a win, or a series win if they can get to the Dodgers bullpen. I do think we go the distance with the Dodgers and clean up with the Padres. We’ve had the Padres number for the last few years. Their strength is their bullpen so, we need an early lead. I don’t think any World Series contender on the AL side will be a breeze by any means, but I do feel pretty good about them being largely mismatched with the NL. And if we play LA and SD in the NLDS/NLCS and find ways to overcome it and advance, then an east coast World Series would definitely be a stomp for us. Even if Boston is coming off a series with the Mariners.

reddit_post,phillies,NoJacket2273,"Mvp odds It's absolutely crazy that the AL side of the MVP race has been looking at the actual value the player has provided to his team. Stats are still being used absolutely but are using the weight of the teams success along with the personal stats. Stats alone Judge wins by a Mile no doubt but Raleigh has provided more of a Team spark, an ""one for all all for one"" fire his team has used as fuel while Judge might be performing personally out of this world but hasn't led to a team wide cohesiveness. Now in the NL its just Ohtani is a God he's the only one worth it. I have a problem with that. 1st and mainly they created a whole rule for him so that he can both bat and pitch... only applies to him so therefore how can it be logically fair to use both pitching and hitting as attributes to evaluate? No other player is both pitching and hitting, so he just gets an automatic advantage to his value? As unbiased as I can be Shwarbs value to the whole team outweighs Ohtanis towards the Dodgers. Kyle gives hope and drive to his teammates when he hits a homerun or a line drive double. Provides a spark that gets others to try harder, think better, be more patient with their approach. Ohtanis great there is no doubt in that. But how many times have weve seen either pitching or only batting that ohtani has been the catalyst tht wakes up the team this year? Maybe a handful. Just look at his last 2 pitching outings. No hits given through 5 and the team just lazily gives it up. Kyle has provided more value to the success of the Phillies this year than Ohtani. Side note. Kyle has almost identical stats to raleigh, Ontani is no where close overall to Judges 2025 stats. Here is the kicker. Raleigh is -150 to win AL MVP even though the only thing statistically better than Judge(+200) is Homeruns. Ohtani who is really not much higher is key stats and also has 30 less rbis sits at -5000 and Kyle is +1600. The discrepancy and obvious bias is very noticeable when comparing each MVP race.",https://reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/1nr0076/mvp_odds/,2025-09-26T12:27:39+00:00,Dodgers,2000

I just recently got back into baseball this season after spending years away after childhood and don't know anything about how the payroll works in general for teams or how likely certain teams are to pay high taxes etc. So my question is who is likely to return and who is likely gone after this season? Feels like it would be a lot of money to retain all of Schwarber, JT, Ranger, and Bader I know Schwarber will be paid practically whatever he asks for and Casty is likely to be traded as well but for the others should I be expecting them to be on a different team next year?",https://reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/1nr4vhp/who_is_likely_gone_after_this_year/,2025-09-26T15:48:12+00:00,A's,615
reddit_comment,phillies,streetsmahts,"The easy ones are Harper, Turner, and Stott. They'll all be back for sure. I say Bohm is back since he's under arbitration and Miller isn't ready yet, but I could see them flipping him in a trade if the right one works out. Marsh I think has played himself into another year in the outfield, especially if they move on from Castellanos (which I think is going to happen). Plus he's under team control, so I'm not sure there are any replacements/upgrades you would get for a similar cost. Schwarber I think is back, but it'll be a stressful few weeks/months while they work out a deal. Ranger is gone, which hurts but there's no chance they're going to pay him what he wants/deserves with their seemingly unshakeable faith in Painter. I wouldn't be surprised if Taijuan is back at the bottom of the rotation next year to eat innings until Painter is ready. Bader is the one I really hope they bring back, but I think he is going to be looking for a multi-year deal. Will Dombrowski go 2-3 years on him with Crawford in the minors? I think it would be a good signing but who knows, there's a reason I'm not in the front office. JT is really up in the air. He's played well enough to start at catcher, but to do it with the Phillies it would be at a decent pay cut I think. I'd guess they try to bring him back at the right price, but if he wants to maximize his dollars he's gone.",https://reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/1nr4vhp/who_is_likely_gone_after_this_year/ngbr34t/,2025-09-26T15:57:36+00:00,A's,1378

reddit_comment,phillies,toofshucker,"Schwarber, JT, Ranger, Kepler. That’s it. Probably trade Casty. Alvarado - team option. Bader - mutual option. I’d bet that Alvarado gets picked up and Bader get resigned for the same amount per year, just gets a few extra years. We will lose about 75 million is salaries from those guys. Resign Schwarber for around 30. That leaves 45 million. I’d be up for tossing 40 million at Kyle Tucker and then filling in the gaps with the rest. Wheeler, Nola, Jesus, Sanchez, Painter, Duran, Alvarado, Strahm, Kerkring. That’s a great pitching staff. Bader, Schwarber, Turner, Harper, Kyle Tucker, Bohm, Stott, Catcher. And then transition from Bohm to Aiden Miller. That’s is a lethal lineup.

reddit_comment,phillies,Icy-Refrigerator-517,"Let's run this thing down C - It's either JT or a Marchan/random lower tier FA timeshare. They are kind of boxed into JT here, and that's not a bad thing 1B - Harper 2B - Was looking kind of iffy for Stott, but the second half has been strong enough. Sosa still has team control, so they run back the platoon SS - Turner 3B - They tried to trade Bohm last year and might do so again. The issue is finding someone on the open market who is any better. The guess is they run Bohm back for one more go round, but if the right deal is there they'd do it. OF - Justin Crawford and...who knows. All options are on the table. Marsh occupying a role seems likely, but not definite. Castellanos is probably gone. Bader they'd love to bring back, I'm sure, but money will talk. There's too many variables and questions to really make any kind of accurate call of what's going to happen here, other than Crawford getting a long look in the spring. DH - Schwarber SP - Wheeler, Sanchez, Luzardo, Nola, Walker, Painter. They're gonna need some kind of depth to augment this, especially if Wheeler's injury lingers. Buehler maybe feels like the right zone for this? They won't go top or even middle of the market shopping here, but most certainly will pick some kind of additional arm. Bye bye Ranger, it's been real. RP - Duran, Strahm, Kerkering, Alvarado, Banks. Some kind of long man takes a spot, a younger guy with options like Lazar too. So maybe one open spot for a veteran middle relief type, a righty. Nothing big, but someone a little more on the proven end or a rebound project (like Romano) that could hit big. Manager - Topper if they go on a deeper run.

reddit_comment,phillies,FIDLARonTheRoofAZ,"I hate to even bring this up, but this is what scares me: * 2008 Phillies Reg Season: 92-70, **Won World Series** * 2009 Phillies Reg Season: 93-69, **Lost World Series** * 2010 Phillies Reg Season: 97-65, **Lost NLCS** * 2011 Phillies Reg Season: 102-60, **Lost NLDS** During our last great run of seasons, we improved every regular season but were slightly less successful in the postseason than the year before. I will also add that in 09, 10 and 11 the team that eliminated us either instantly became World Champ (09 Yankees) or *eventually* became world champ (10 Giants, 11 Cardinals). Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades but I really feel the 08-11 Phillies were really close to winning like 2 to 4 titles in a row. Here is what gives me hope *this* October: 1. We literally cannot be eliminated in an earlier round than last year now. We will for sure be in the NLDS. 2. I believe we have had very good teams the last few years but our problem in October has been the lack of a true shutdown closer and too many players in the lineup not simply getting on base and working at bats. I truly think we've corrected those issues, although the 2 different 1 run leads blown via solo home runs off Duran over the past week and a half *does* concern me. But seriously if we have Duran in 2023 I *know* he does better than Kimbrel in Arizona and the NLCS doesn't even have to return to Philly for games 6 and 7. And the addition of Bader, plus some more lineup flexibility with these guys having some better at bats since about the all-star break feels like we are better equipped. The loss of Wheeler is huge, though. And October is a crapshoot anyway. But I hope we can do it.

With Harris/Elder/the BP struggling in the first half. Instead, they continued to grind out quality games even if it didn't result in a winning second half, the team did not give up. Even in game 161, Olson and Snit getting tossed shows that effort. People don't get that upset unless they care. 2024 felt more like ""oh well, we'll be healthy next year"" while 2025, for me, feels like, ""They'll fight no matter what happens in 2026"".

reddit_comment,Braves,theoxfordtailor,"I was at a minor league game and I saw an umpire make an atrocious call and then another. If memory serves, they were both ridiculous basepath interference calls. The manager went out, got in his face, and was ejected. The next day, the manager was ejected before the game even began. I have no idea what was said, but he was tossed as the lineup cards were exchanged. I have no idea what was said, but he was clearly still heated over the previous night's game.

These aren't large samples but the inputs match the outputs. He has amazing extension on his pitches and is still getting good movement by evidence of the swing and miss in the 2025 profile. The problem is the same one that AJSS/Elder have in that when they do get hit, it's extra bases at a minimum. He also walks too many people.

reddit_post,Braves,TechnicalLeave6989,"How Belief Powered the Braves to World Champions In November 2021, the Atlanta Braves achieved what many thought impossible: they claimed their second World Series title in six games, overcoming a myriad of challenges along the way. From injuries to roster changes and a skeptical fanbase, this victory was more than just a triumph in baseball-it was a statement of resilience, unity, and unwavering belief. A simple yet profound quote from Joe Buck encapsulated the essence of their journey: “The Atlanta Braves have done it! They have overcome everything thrown in front of them! And they are the champions of baseball!.” In this article, we explore how the Braves, against all odds, proved that belief in themselves was the key to their remarkable championship run.

I also had two 27 game parking passes in Lot 43 because at the time Truist opened, the Braves had memory points and 1 point equalled 1 parking pass in Lot 11. 2023 my total package was $3,316 2026 my invoice was $5,850 Looking at that cost breakdown just two tickets in Vista Infield is just over $5,400. If you get parking which you have to unless you live close enough to walk you have to purchase a full season parking (they longer do 27 game plans) which for lot 43 I'm guessing is $20-$25 per game. Thats roughly $7,500 for season tickets and parking for seats i had the first 9 years of the park.

reddit_post,Braves,KTurnUp,"This is the first Braves Managerial search in 40 years Chuck Tanner in 1986 was the last manager hired outside of the organization and not midseason or immediately after the season as part of a succession plan Tanner was fire midseason 1988 and they promoted AA manager Russ Nixon. He was fired midseason 1990 by Bobby Cox who named himself the manager. Then when Bobby was set to retire Fredi was very quickly promoted. Then Fredi was fired and Snit was promoted to interim and then given the full time job after the season. Crazy that anyone under the age of 40 has never lived through a Braves managerial search or outside hire. EDIT: some people rightfulyl mentioned I had a couple things wrong here. 1. Fredi wasn't promoted. he was with the Marlins but got fired midseason. But he was always the top choice and the only person interviewed and it was lined up before the season even ended, so I don't think it's a stretch to say there was no search there 2. We did interview a couple people before taking the interim tag off Snitker. So probably fair to say that was indeed a search. Overall I do still feel like it's very notable that this is likely to be the first hire in a long long time that is not coming from the staff or someone that had been staff for a long time.

reddit_comment,Braves,TraderTed2,"here’s the thing: If Snit was confident he wanted to retire, it would’ve been announced weeks ago. (Heck, even if the Braves wanted him back, you can’t keep someone from retiring.) If the Braves were exceedingly interested in having Snit back, they could’ve extended him. Teams don’t generally keep around managers who manage on lame-duck deals. (If your response is “Maybe Snit wants to go year-to-year,” there’s no harm to him in having additional years on the contract. He can just retire and forfeit them.) So we’re in one of two places: 1) Snit and the Braves are both genuinely undecided. This, I think, is the party line. Snit has talked about wanting to take some time to think about it, and while AA has said Snit will be in the org as long as he wants, I don’t think it was accidental that AA didn’t say “Snit can manage as long as he wants.” 2) Snit is leaning towards returning but the Braves don’t want him back and are hoping to end this in a graceful place where Snit says he’s retiring rather than the org having to say they’re not renewing his contract. Totally possible Snit is back next year, but it’s just weird not to have heard anything strong one way or another.",https://reddit.com/r/Braves/comments/1ntd2e3/weekly_braves_postseason_discussion_thread_monday/ngvpjgh/,2025-09-29T19:23:56+00:00,Braves,1185

Ideally he gets a year or two of experience coaching first, but he’s about the only one I trust enough to give a chance without any experience. Even if he wanted to retire now and pass on that last $6M, I don’t know if it would even be possible. Teams have to get permission to talk to other teams’ coaches, but would a current player even be allowed to do that?
