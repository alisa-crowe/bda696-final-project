Having not watched ESPN in forever I was just horrified how bad it was overall. Two things that stuck out to me not mentioned in article: 1. After Yoshida gets a PH single, Perez says ""You area all wondering why he isn't being run for"". No, I am not. It is the 7th inning, there is 1 out and a man on 1B only. He is a PH and you aren't wasting another bench spot. Who the hell would EVER pinch run there? 2. After the Yankees used a challenge in the 9th, they say ""....use your challenge there"". They never mention there are 2 in the playoffs. You would only know it because the UMP said it. It completely changes the context of the challenge - it would have been insane to do with only 1 challenge.

reddit_comment,baseball,sameth1,">In the third inning, when Nick Sogard ripped a line drive single into left field, Ravech commended Bellinger for cutting the ball off, a routine play that was made with ease. Perez added to this by rambling about Bellinger’s ability to play all three outfield positions this season, rather than ever talking about Sogard’s hit. I was listening to the game while cooking at the time, and I assumed that he had gotten the out by the way they were talking. That's how bad they are at commentating the game. >And finally, in the bottom of the ninth, when Cody Bellinger singled to load the bases, Ravech delivered by far my favorite line of the night: “Those singles come on five pitches, and this place is getting off right now!” >I quickly checked to make sure that Reese McGuire hadn’t been re-signed, but thankfully, he’s on the Chicago Cubs roster this postseason.

reddit_comment,baseball,Di5pel,"maybe the reliever that came in with nobody on base and just needed to get 2 outs has some blame? Boone made the right decision. Fried was at 100+ pitches, had already woven in and out of traffic throughout the night, and his control was very clearly becoming shaky. Taking him out there ensured the reliever came in with clean bases and literally only needed 2 outs. I can guarantee if Fried was left in, got someone on base, and the reliever let him score, people would be bitching about ""why did Boone wait until there was trouble to take him out, he was obviously losing control"". Boone made the higher percentage play. As a manager at a certain point you have to make a call and trust that the players will actually do their job. It blows my mind that people really think he made a mistake here.

reddit_comment,baseball,xho-,"The loss is primarily on Luke Weaver, Giancarlo Stanton and Trent Grisham. Guys we have rode the whole season and unequivocally trust. (Maybe not weaver anymore) Boone messed up in the fact that he forced an entire lefty lane against Chapman after Goldschmidt (Righty), Judge(Righty), and Bellinger(Best LHH against Lefties in MLB) all got concurrent hits against Chapman in the ninth. Bringing in Jazz prematurely as a “defensive sub” was not smart and gave the surprise pinch hit option completely away. There was no longer any righties to go to with Rosario out.

reddit_comment,baseball,Reidzyt,Look I love shitting on Boone. It's hilarious to me that the Yankees still employ him. He made the right call. It's not on him that the bullpen couldn't come through. And even more so the offense couldn't do anything other than the Volpe homer. I feel like this article would've been written exactly the same if he left Fried in and then the Red Sox still won. Me personally I would've pulled Fried there too. He was starting to yank pitches and couldn't hit the outside part of the plate against RHH's. His pitch count was high.

Guys just didn't perform.,https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nv89kh/sherman_aaron_boone_may_have_cost_yankees_their/nh7zfhk/,2025-10-01T17:36:21+00:00,Yankees,271

Today, as October has started, the month of glorious moments across the 5 most prestigeous leagues in the world as they conclude their seasons has come at last while the winter league season begins. Over the years, this month has been the month of champions, as this has been the month wherein these 5 leagues hold their championship series, and wherein over a century of oustanding performances by players across these leagues in front of watching fans have been etched into history. Once more, these days of October will show how much baseball has been regarded and treasured as a part of the sporting world, and the many moments created in this month will be joined by new moments and memories about to be made within these weeks of this month. And for the fans who will be present, these moments that will be made in the stadiums this month they will cherish for the rest of their lives. May this month be once more a month of wonder and joy whose spirit extends to the sport across the world.

reddit_comment,baseball,theAlpacaLives,"The thing I say I miss most about baseball as I remember it growing up was the starting pitcher as a dominant game-controlling force. On his day, the starter could control the whole game if he was at his best, and single-handedly make it winnable for the opposition if he wasn't. Nowadays, many pitchers rarely finish 6 innings, and lifting them earlier than that is pretty routine, turning over to a parade of one-inning relievers. In the playoffs, we see even great starters get hooked in the early innings at the first sign of trouble. Today's playoff games were an absolute treat for lovers of close well-pitched games. Seeing so many managers put trust in their aces to pitch deep even when games were razor-close, and seeing those aces deliver, warmed my heart that really thought the age of the starting pitcher was all but over. We saw two games where both pitchers finished six, and twice the starter pitched into the eighth and handed the ball to the closer for a four-out save. Absolutely beautiful.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nuukiq/starting_pitching_through_the_first_3_playoff/nh56ln9/,2025-10-01T06:27:48+00:00,Yankees,1010

reddit_post,baseball,eekbarbaderkle,"The Red Sox have two players on their roster (Rob Refsnyder & Steven Matz) who last appeared in the postseason in 2015. It always warms my heart to see guys returning to postseason baseball after really long stretches without playing in the playoffs. So it's especially neat to me that the Sox have two such guys on their roster this year. Matz is surprising. He made 3 postseason starts as a rookie for the Mets in 2015, but hasn't pitched in the postseason since then. To be fair, he was on the Cardinals' postseason roster in 2022, but never appeared in a game. He was also a member of the starting rotation for the 2016 Mets, who lost in the Wild Card game, and the 2021 Blue Jays, who won 91 games but didn't make the playoffs somehow. For his sake, I hope he gets into a game this time around. Refsnyder also made an appearance for a New York team as a rookie in 2015. He was the Yankees' starting second baseman in the AL Wild Card game, which they lost to Houston. Refsnyder went 0-for-3. The Sox also have Justin Wilson, who last appeared in the playoffs in 2018 for the Cubs. Do any other teams have long individual postseason droughts that could be snapped this October? Edit: Michael Conforto was a candidate, as he also has not appeared in the postseason since he was a rookie with the 2015 Mets. But the Dodgers just announced [their roster](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F6y1kdtxq8csf1.jpeg) for the Wild Card round, and Conforto is not on it.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nuhxtf/the_red_sox_have_two_players_on_their_roster_rob/,2025-09-30T16:31:31+00:00,Yankees,1486

reddit_post,baseball,kraftj87,"Stats no one asked for: Team leaders in incorrect strike three calls Thought this was at least mildly interesting. I'm doing my usual Baseball Savant sleuthing after the season ends. Looking at various ridiculous metrics that mostly don't mean anything. I was curious to see what players and/or teams were the most frequent victims of bad strike-three calls by umpires. So I plugged in the parameters of two-strike counts, where the pitches were out of the zone and the result was a called strike. To my surprise, the Yankees were #1. Maybe it's just being a Mets fan, I've always heard the grumblings that Yankees are the league darling and they get all the calls. Well at least this year, they did not.

reddit_comment,baseball,notyou-justme,"A single postseason team in the top-10, and that’s quite possibly only because of Aaron Judge. That gives a little insight into how much impact the home plate umpire really has. In fact, if I’m not mistaken, I think the Astros are the only other team in the top-10 that even had a winning record. I hope we figure out a good integration of the ABS and live umpiring. I really do. I think the umpires need a lot of help in today’s game. There’s so much more movement and velocity on almost every pitch now. I’m not trying to give them an excuse, but that could at least partly explain how it seems to have gotten so much worse recently…even with Angel Hernandez gone (thank the maker for that!).",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nuaswv/stats_no_one_asked_for_team_leaders_in_incorrect/nh0ep0g/,2025-09-30T14:17:04+00:00,Yankees,694

reddit_comment,baseball,ThatsBushLeague,"Generally speaking: The teams at the top don't put the ball in play as much as the teams at the bottom. The teams at the bottom are in fewer 2 strike counts because of this. And are also more likely to swing at a two strike pitch, so they don't get called strikes against them. As for your perception thing. The Yankees have almost always been top 3-5 in the other end of this spectrum. Their pitchers get the strike three calls at a higher rate. This isn't solely a bad outcome for the hitter thing. There is another side to this. But I do believe, this was an outlier year for them on both ends.

reddit_post,baseball,Crazy_Baseball3864,"Bobby Shantz turned 100 years old on September 26th. Winner of the 1952 MVP award, he is the last living person to play in the MLB in the 1940s and the last to play under Connie Mack I just now noticed this and knew it was coming but wish I hadn't missed it in all the excitement of the end of the season. Shantz made his MLB debut with the Athletics in 1949, and played for 2 seasons under Mack, and won the MVP in 1952 after a 24-7 season and a 2.48 ERA. He never reached that level again but was a solid pitcher for most of his career, making 3 All-Star games, winning 8 gold gloves and winning an ERA title with the Yankees in 1957 and winning a title with them in 1958, his career ending in 1964. He is currently the 2nd oldest living person who played in the majors, behind 101-year-old Bill Greason, who pitched in 3 games with the Cardinals in 1954 and is one of the last two known living people who played in the Negro Leagues in the period the MLB considers it a professional league (1920-1948), which he pitched in 8 games in 1948. The other living person is 98-year-old Ron Teasley who appeared in 2 games in 1948.

reddit_comment,baseball,Bobo4037,"Great stuff! He is also the last living person to play for the Philadelphia Athletics. He was selected by the “Washington Senators 2.0” from the Yankees in the expansion draft after the 1960 season, but he never played for the Senators. Two days after picking him, they traded him to the Pirates, who had just beaten the Yankees in the World Series. Then after the 1961 season, he was picked in an expansion draft AGAIN, this time by the Houston Colt .45s. There’s something you could win a bet on at a bar, and it will probably never happen again. And finally, he was also part of the legendary Lou Brock for Ernie Broglio trade.

reddit_post,baseball,mcfien,"Ranking the Potential World Series Matchups There are 36 potential World Series matchups this year. This exercise seeks to rank the top 10 matchup on the basis of history, uniqueness, and my own personal taste Before that, some stats about the potential matchups: * Of the 36 potential matchups, we have seen 15 before: Dodgers-Yankees (12 times), Cubs-Tigers (4 times), Dodgers-Red Sox (2 times), Cubs-Yankees (2 times), Phillies-Yankees (2 times), Reds-Yankees (2 times), Dodgers-Guardians (1 time), Padres-Yankees (1 time), Phillies-Blue Jays (1 time), Padres-Tigers (1 time), Cubs-Red Sox (1 time), Cubs-Guardians (1 time), Reds-Red Sox (1 times), Phillies-Red Sox (1 time) Reds-Tigers (1 time). * That means we have 21 new potential showdowns! That includes 11 from the two teams that have never won a pennant in their current league (Brewers and Mariners) as well as the following 10 matchups: Blue Jays-Dodgers, Blue Jays-Cubs, Blue Jays-Padres, Blue Jays-Reds, Guardians-Phillies, Guardians-Padres, Guardians-Reds, Red Sox-Padres, Tigers-Dodgers, Tigers-Phillies. Here is my objective completely unbiased and indisputable top 10 potential matchups in no particular order: 1. **Cubs-Guardians II: 2016 Is Back Baby -** In 2016, a time traveler went back in time to try to get their beloved Cubbies to win a title. Instead, the timeline irreparably splintered as the Cubs and Indians faced off in a guaranteed curse-breaking World Series, bringing a combined 176 years of pain. The Cubs came back from 3-1 down to win in extra innings in game 7. Can Cleveland find some joy and end what is now a 77 year drought? 2. **Reds-Guardians: Battle for Ohio -** These two original franchises have never met in the World Series. The Reds would return to the World Series for the first time since 1990, while the Guardians would seek to end Cleveland's 77 year title drought. Neither of these teams looked playoff bound a few weeks ago; the Guards were 15.5 GB of the Tigers just a few short months ago. An all-Ohio World Series wasn't on my bingo card, but anything can happen. 3. **Mariners-Padres: The Vedder Cup -** The long suffering Mariners make their first Fall Classic and find their old Vedder Cup rivals waiting for them. These teams got paired off as rivals in the early inter-league days due to lacking natural inter-league geographic rivals. The rivalry would get real as someone takes home their first title after 48 and 56 years of respective waiting. 4. **Mariners-Brewers: The Pilot Series -** Due to political shenanigans, the Seattle Pilots came into existence in 1969 long before Seattle was ready to host a pro team. They suffered through one terrible season before moving to Milwaukee in 1970 and becoming the Brewers. Old Seattle and New Seattle meet! Someone gets their first title! 5. **Blue Jays - Brewers: Brew Jays -** The number 1 seeds from each league meet in an improbable showdown that very few would have bet on before the season. No one hates either of these teams! 6. **Blue Jays-Phillies II: The Tariff Tussle -** Last time these two teams met in a Fall Classic, Joe Carter touched them all in the only come from behind, series-clinching walk off homer in World Series history. Could the Phillies even the score 32 years later? 7. **Cubs-Tigers V: The Billy Goat Returns -** This was a common early matchup, with these teams meeting in 4 World Series pre-expansion. The Tigers quieted Wrigley in game 7 in 1945 in the series that originated the Curse of the Billy Goat. The Cubs wouldn't see the World Series again until 2016. 8. **Dodgers-Yankees XIII: Judge's Revenge -** Goliath vs. Goliath! Last year, the Yankees fumbled games 1 and 5, with Aaron Judge literally dropping a routine fly ball to spark a Dodger comeback win in the title clinching game. This series would feature the game's two biggest stars and the first immediate World Series rematch since (who else?) the Dodgers and Yankees faced off in 1977 and 1978. 9. **Dodgers-Red Sox III: Return of the Mook** \- Mookie and the 2018 Sox handled the Dodgers in 5 games. The team sold him to the Dodgers after the 2019 season so that John Henry could finance his Broadway musical ""&Juliet"" (wait, that's not quite right...). Could Mookie beat his old squad to earn his 4th ring? 10. **Reds-Red Sox II: Party Like It's 1975 -** 50 years ago, these teams played one of the greatest World Series ever. Carlton Fisk waved an extra inning walk-off home run fair in game 6 to force game 7. But, the Sox choked away a 3-0 lead in game 7 at home, with the Reds playing small ball to get Ken Griffey across in the 9th and win the game and the series 4-3.

reddit_comment,baseball,navycap115,"Interesting fact about the 1969 Seattle Pilots shenanigans: I believe that American League side of the expansion (also including the Royals) was originally for 1971. However a Missouri senator threatened an anti trust suit against MLB if they didn't expand with a team in Kansas City, and by extension, Seattle. This essentially forced the American League to expand two years earlier than the intended year, which was a contributing factor to the Pilots' bad inaugural season and their move to Milwaukee. (It's also partially Bud Selig really wanting a franchise there lol) So it could've been likely that the Pilots had more time to prepare for their inaugural season, therefore maybe wouldn't have had a very troubling season both in play and financially, and therefore wouldn't have left for Milwaukee, rather than playing in what was essentially a hastily upgraded minor league ballpark in poor condition.

reddit_comment,baseball,Qeltar_,"Looking at this, I think Hudson made the right call. This is really several things happening in sequence. Sure, in hindsight, he would have been safe, but that's not how it's playing out in real time: 1. Ball goes to Jazz. Eaton is barely reaching third. He has to stop or Jazz throws home and he's toast. 2. Now he's stopped and back near third. Jazz throws to first, but there's plenty of time for the 1B to throw home assuming he fields it cleanly. 3. He doesn't field it cleanly, but the ball doesn't get far enough away given where Eaton is. If Hudson had a crystal ball, sure, Eaton would have been safe, but he doesn't.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nvqhzf/lowlight_down_1_run_red_sox_3rd_base_coach_kyle/nhahrdq/,2025-10-02T01:28:44+00:00,Red Sox,626

They’re top 3 in the league on both sides of the ball. They got multiple bullpen pieces back just in time for the playoffs. By all accounts, this is the best Brewers team of my life, and a team poised for a deep playoff run. But as Milwaukee has been reminded five times in the last six years, nothing is guaranteed in October. While their 5 consecutive playoff series losses might not tell us anything about the future, it is a haunting reminder of just how fast a promising season can end. And while every path to the World Series is uphill, the Brewers might have it the hardest of any team who has earned a bye. The Padres had an incredible trade deadline and have been one of the best teams in baseball, and the Cubs have been a strong team all season as well. In the regular season, the Brewers only lost the season series to 4 NL teams, and only 2 of them made the playoffs. They will face one of those 2 in the division series.**(Cont. in Comments)** |**97-65** **2**|[Philadelphia Phillies](#f/phi)|**Phillies**|**0**| The Phillies have continued to do what they've done under Dave Dombrowski, improving their win total steadily each year. They've now made the play offs in four straight seasons and have won back to back NL East titles. The story this year was Kyle Schwarber's continued improvement as a hitter finishing just short of Ryan Howard's record of 58 home runs. The other story was Cristopher Sanchez only being out-pitched by Paul Skenes in the National League. **(Cont. in Comments)** |**96-66** **3**|[Seattle Mariners](#f/sea)|**Mariners**|**+3**| HANG THE BANNER, FOR THE FIRST FULL SEASON IN ALMOST A DECADE WE HAVE A NEW AL WEST CHAMPION! Despite the hangover sweep, the vibes are the best they've been in a long time - yes, the drought was broken a few years back, but there weren't really a lot of playoff expectations for that team. This year, however, it really feels like this team could make a deep run. Eleven wins to go. *Up next: ALDS vs. AL Central grudge match winner* |**90-72** **4**|[Toronto Blue Jays](#f/tor)|**Blue Jays**|**-1**| I've been a fan of the Blue Jays since 1989. I've been lucky enough to root for two World Series-teams, plus a few squads that seemed like they might make a run at titles back in '15/'16 and then again, somehow, starting in 2021. This team, though? This team might be my favorite of the bunch. A core of mostly homegrown guys turned stars, some really fun trade/free agent pickups, a few no-names who came up from Buffalo and made an immediate impact, and what might turn out to be the most amazing rookie run we've ever had. A few numbers/guys that stand out: 94 wins on the year for the 5th-best mark in franchise history. An unbelievable 88-DAY LONG RUN atop the AL East after grabbing it on July 3rd and never letting go. **(Cont. in Comments)** |**94-68** **5**|[Los Angeles Dodgers](#f/lad)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| This whole season, a couple of the Dodgers biggest issues have been with health and with having every part of the team working well at the same time. They seem to be pulling it together just in time for the start of the playoffs. They were unable to secure a bye, so a matchup against the red hot Reds will have to be the starting point. With a rotation of Snell, Ohtani (unleashed), Yamamoto, and Glasnow, the rotation should be enough to get us to our various length guys who are just starters in the pen. The biggest question mark for this team is how the bullpen will shake out. Many of the supposedly solid relievers the team has had have been consistently struggling, so I'm still curious to see who will get a roster spot. |**93-69** **6**|[New York Yankees](#f/nyy)|**Yankees**|**-1**| Last year I wrote a vivid hype fanfic for this. This year I’m just gonna air some grievances against the little brothers. All in good spirits of course. It’s heel time bitches. Almost a year removed from the Soto sweepstakes, I still really wish we could’ve offered Soto a playoff contending team. But I mean, how do you beat Steve Cohen’s pitch? He’s serious about winning, and it really showed this year. The ‘25 Mets were exactly the type of team I was hoping Juan would get: one we wouldn’t be watching in the wild card round. To the Dodgers, we’re coming at you Nestor-less and ready for revenge. We don’t want to be the ones to send Kershaw packing on a low note (he’s my favorite pitcher of all time, I really don’t), but we will. You better hope Aaron Boone doesn’t use Devin Williams for high-leverage. Or more accurately, we better hope. And the Astros! I hope their fans enjoyed their time as America’s most hated team. It was nice to let them try on the crown, but it’s time to let the real villains shine again. **(Cont. in Comments)**|**94-68** **7**|[San Diego Padres](#f/sdp)|**Padres**|**+2**| Another 90 win season, and 4 winning seasons in a row for the Padres, who also set another attendance record at Petco (beating last year’s with 42,401). Realistically, this era of Padres baseball is the most competitive that the club’s ever had, and any negatives shouldn’t take away from that. I do feel that AJ has put together a competitive team once again, Nick Pivetta is our ace that we added, while Ramon Laureano was one of many trade deadline acquisitions that SD made to try and bolster their chances in October. The division was once again just out of reach, but the Pads had a real shot at it from the opener to the last week of the season. After a great start though, the Padres started to sputter a bit mid-year, and really limped to the finish in my opinion with a struggle in August/September, record bolstered by wins against the worst teams in both leagues, and admittedly a good last week to end it on. **(Cont. in Comments)** |**90-72** **8**|[Chicago Cubs](#f/chc)|**Cubs**|**-1**| The Cubs wrapped up their season on a high, sweeping the Cardinals to finish with a record of 92-70. While losng out on the NL Central title to the Brewers yet again stings, returning to the postseason for the first time in a full season since 2018 makes the regular season an unqualified success, especially with the instability in the rotation. Justin Steele's last start was in mid April, Shota Imanaga and Jameson Taillon both had length IL stints, but nevertheless the Cubs got vastly unexpected performances from All Star Matthew Boyd, NL ROtY contender Cade Horton, and Colin rea who vastly outpitched his preseason expectation of being a swingman. **(Cont. in Comments)** |**92-70** **9**|[Cleveland Guardians](#f/cle)|**Guardians**|**+2**| We were 15.5 games behind the division leading Tigers. We were 8 games below 500. We had a less than 1 percent chance of making the playoffs. I didn't think we would. We had two players suspended for gambling. But against all odds, the Guardians won the division and are going to the playoffs. We didn't just win it, we won it with four runs in the tenth in Game 162 and the crowd went crazy. We clinched a playoff spot with a HBP. This team has defied so many odds, why not defy more odds? After all, we made MLB history and proved that yes, we CAN go to the playoffs in odd numbered years. Oh, and we ended the Asstros' reign of terror of going to the postseason. I just wish MLB didn't schedule what might be our only playoff games during my work day. Now I hope ownership signs some good free agents during the offseason. |**88-74** **10**|[Boston Red Sox](#f/bos)|**Red Sox**|**-2**| Somehow, the Red Sox returned. After three seasons with decent first halves before running out of steam post ASB, the Sox have finally managed to land themselves in the postseason. Is this a world series caliber team? No, probably not (although weirder things have happened), but simply returning is enough for the endless promises of the future core to finally feel real. I'd be a lot more optimistic with a healthy Roman Anthony, and if they can manage to hang in there until he returns (his estimated 4-6 week injury timeline has him back most likely in the ALCS) the lineup would be really strong. For now though, I'm just gonna soak in whatever Boston playoff ball I can get. |**89-73** **11**|[Detroit Tigers](#f/det)|**Tigers**|**-1**| Hey, the good thing is that all our records reset at 0-0 now, right??? There's limping into the playoffs... then there's what the Tigers did the second half this year. Thankfully, none of it matters anymore and we've got the best arm in baseball starting on Tuesday. Let's do this. |**87-75** **12**|[Cincinnati Reds](#f/cin)|**Reds**|**+2**| WE MADE THE PLAYOFFS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FUCK YOU METS FUCK YOU BREWERS FUCK YOU CUBS FUCK YOU CARDINALS FUCK YOU PIRATES FUCK YOU BOB FUCK ALL OF YOU WE’RE IN THE PLAYOFFS BITCHES I DON’T CARE IF WE’RE GOING TO GET CURB STOMPED BY THE DODGERS WE’RE IN THE PLAYOFFS HAHAHAHAHAHA…………Anyway I’m choosing the Dodgers to repeat. |**83-79**",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nttpq0/2025_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_28_special/,2025-09-29T20:52:27+00:00,Red Sox,10475

reddit_comment,baseball,kasutori_Jack,"#American League West End of Season Write-Ups [Oakland A's](#f/OAK) Non-Denominational A's By /u/thiiiiiiisguy There is a lot to look forward to for next season in Sacramento, and no it isnt the new alternate uniforms. Nicks Kurtz is likely to win the AL Rookie of the Year after having a record breaking first season in the bigs. Jacob Wilson who held the favorite odds for ALROY up until his injury where Kurtz jumped in the lead and never looked back. Three players with 30+ home runs and 5 players with 20+ home runs, Shea Langeliers and Nick Kurtz 1 and 3 in Extra-base hits post the All-Star break. If the Athletics can find a rotation and relief staff who wont take them out of games we could see a playoff run next year in Sacramento in an AL West open for the taking. [Texas Rangers](#f/TEX)Rangers By /u/faderp91 It is poetic that this Rangers team finished the season 81-81 as they have to be the most mid team I have ever witness. There was some very good along the way, like the ptiching staff and defensive effort being the best I have ever seen as a fan. There was some good as well, like Jacob deGrom making 30 starts for the first time in a long time after multiple years of injuries. Jack Leiter finishing his rookie year with a really strong showing which has me excited to see him continue to grow as a pitcher. There was some okay, like injuries to key guys late in the year forcing young ones like Freeman and Osuna to rise to the occasion. Unfortunately the good did not outweight the bad as while the team had to deal with untimely injuries the offense just could never get the consistent output that they needed to win when it mattered. Guys like Joc Pederson, Adolis Garcia, and Jonah Heim regressed hard this year and outside of Joc, I am afraid we have seen the last of Adolis and Jonah in a Rangers uniform. Josh Jung, while he led the team in batting average still had to be sent down to AAA this year due to a major slump and inability to adjust. While the offense misfired the bullpen made things worse as they were 2nd in blown saves. It speaks volumes that the Rangers had the highest run differantial in the division but finished in 3rd place. Bruce Boochy's contract ended this year and I'll be very interested in seeing if he will be back. My guess is he will not be. Multiple reports have made light of the fact that the vibes in the clubhouse are dogshit and maybe there is change on the horizon. Here is to the 2025 Texas Rangers, may you live in purgatory because you were mid as hell. [Houston Astros](#f/hou)Astros By /u/clutchyball I don't think it's a stretch to say the Astros' golden era ended after the 2024 season, but there's no argument that it's done now. What a run, though! The cheating scandal aside (which fucking SUCKED and I wish had not happened), I can't believe I got to witness my favorite team accomplish the following: - 8 consecutive trips to the postseason - 2 World Series championships - 4 American League pennants - 7 straight trips to the ALCS - 7 AL West titles - 99 playoff games (a clean 100 would have been nice) If you told the little kid version of me who cried after the Pujols home run in 2005 that I'd have this to look forward to as an adult, I wouldn't believe you. Back in the present day, this season was ugly. Much of it was marred by injuries, but it became apparent that the cupboard was bare and that we really don't have many long term answers in the organization. Our trade deadline, minus Correa (who performed well), was a failure. Also, did Bagwell curse the 1B position somehow? Some things that need to be addressed this offseason: - Injury management and return to play procedures. - How do we restock our farm system? - Starting pitching - The infield logjam - Hitting approach The bright spots this season include Hunter Brown's ascent to ace level, our annual Random Minor Leaguer Who Rakes™ (Zach Cole), and Jeremy Pena's incredible year at the plate (derailed, of course, by injuries). I do think the combination of our barren farm system, injury-prone roster, and Crane's refusal to hand out contracts beyond a particular year/dollar figure (aside from his golf buddies) is going to complicate the team's future. Would love to be proven wrong, but I'm not very optimistic.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nttpq0/2025_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_28_special/ngw9zwc/,2025-09-29T21:02:08+00:00,Red Sox,4273

reddit_comment,baseball,kasutori_Jack,"##National League West End of Season Write-Ups [San Francisco Giants](#f/SFG)Giants By /u/steepdowngrade It's one thing to be mid the entire season and finish exactly at .500 and it's another to give fans a rollercoaster they were never sure they met the height requirements for. The Dodgers and Padres taking the division felt like a foregone conclusion but to the credit of both the Giants and DBacks, they certainly made the playoff picture interesting. Congrats to Willy Adames on clinching the Giants' first season having a 30-homer player since Bonds in 2004. Seeing him mash alongside Rafael Devers was always a treat and it's a sham they couldn't put together enough wins to sneak into the playoffs, but I'm hopeful for them, along with Heliot Ramos and Matt Chapman to really put on an offensive show going into 2026. Logan Webb had yet another fantastic year, Robby Ray had some great outings himself, and Justin Verlander finally got himself some illustrious wins. The bullpen did great all season long even after the trade deadline shakeup, although it's a shame that they'll likely be without Randy Rodriguez for some time. There's plenty to be hopeful for moving into next season, with some holes to fill and some young talent still to mature and put things together. Not to mention the recent news of Bob Melvin's dismissal, good riddance, hopefully the Giants find someone who can truly lead this team and make them the best versions of themselves. Until then, enjoy the postseason, go Mariners, go do the thing. [San Diego Padres](#f/SDP)Padres By /u/beso760 Another 90 win season, and 4 winning seasons in a row for the Padres, who also set another attendance record at Petco (beating last year’s with 42,401).

The Padres are not favored going into Wrigley for the short-series. This is a team with weaknesses. Starting pitching after Pivetta is shaky, and stars like Manny, Tatis, and Xander did not have their best seasons. I don’t believe that the club is in the same tier as teams like the Phillies and Brewers in the NL. It’s tough to make the playoffs multiple years in a row, and see players get older and not be able to get the goal of every team in April. Don’t want to waste this core, and all these winning seasons. I just think it can get easy to get caught up in the moment, as I’d like to have a bit more confidence in San Diego going into the post-season. Still, anything can happen. I just wish I could watch this series. The games start at noon out here.

reddit_comment,baseball,kasutori_Jack,"##National League East End of Season Write-Ups [Washington Nationals](#f/WSH)Nationals By /u/kornthrowaway The 2025 Nats finished 66-96, 5 games below their 71-91 record of the past 2 seasons. If I had to sum up this season in 5 words it would be: ""Disappointing, but not wholly unexpected."" There's an air of uncertainty hanging about the baseball club and it's front office as the Lerners finally turned the page and hired Paul Toboni as the new President of Baseball Operations. Hell, it is kinda poetic that even Bob Carpenter decided to hang it up after 20 years as the voice of Nationals baseball. This upcoming offseason feels like a crucial turning point in Nats history and I think there are 5 major questions Nats fans might have about the future of their team moving forward. * *Will the Lerners open their checkbooks for free agents and infrastructure spending this offseason?* This is probably the biggest looming question any Nats fan might have about this upcoming Toboni era. I want to believe Toboni wouldn’t have taken the job without assurances on spending, whether that's on free agency and getting veterans in the building to help out the baby Nationals, or on building the amateur scouting infrastructure/team from the ground up. Personally, I hope they acquire a frontline starter this offseason and [take a page out of the Orioles book](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/02/11/orioles-plan-21m-development-facility-in-fla/) by investing in a player development facility, but I wont be holding my breath. * *How can Paul Toboni modernize the Nats organization?* This is kind of an offshoot question regarding infrastructure spending, but before Rizzo was fired, the Nats front office was described as ""being in the dark ages"" when it came to analytics. Toboni was hired for his background in scouting and player development and I'm curious to see what changes he will implement to help the Nats turn things around in those departments. The Nats famously wouldn't dish out the dough on the Trajekt Arc system, being 1 of only 5 teams in MLB not to have one in their facilities. If this team is serious about competing, they can't short change the players on equipment like that. * *Who will be hired as the GM and the clubhouse manager?* I think one of the things that Nats fans can universally agree on is the fact that our coaching staff is not up to par. I fully expect Toboni and whoever he hires as his GM to clean house there and get some much-needed fresh faces in the building. The 2025 Nats made so many bone-headed outs on the basepaths and I don't think it's an accident that our pitching staff was one of the worst in MLB. It's also no secret that James Wood entered a 2 month slump after he started getting ready for the HR derby and and the team lacked the developmental support to pull him out of it. That has to be addressed if this team expects to have any sort of sustained success in the future. * *Does Paul Toboni want to reset the stalled rebuild and start from the ground up with his guys?* Before Toboni was hired, two of the guys remaining in the front office who I felt like were doing a good job (Scouting Director Danny Haas and Senior Director of Amateur Scouting Brad Ciolek) saw the writing on the wall and left for greener pastures. When Toboni inevitably replaces their positions and hires his own guys, I am curious of the direction he takes this rebuild in. There was already a bunch of trade talk swirling around Gore at the deadline, and beyond the outfield, few positions seem locked in for 2026. Wood and Lile are expected to lead the Nats offense of the future and although Crews had a disappointing season at the plate, I still believe there's time for him to turn it around. * *Who will be the next voice of Nationals baseball?* Bob Carpenter has retired and the Nationals are free to choose where their games will be broadcasted for the first time in team history. MASN seemed to want Dan Kolko to take up the mantle, but the Nats are no longer handcuffed to that terrible broadcasting deal. The simple move would probably be taking Dave Jageler from our amazing radio broadcasting team, but it's hard to imagine breaking up that beloved duo. --- Although this year marks the 6th consecutive losing season, I remain cautiously optimistic about the Nationals' future. I think that there are good pieces on this team but it needs good leadership — both in the clubhouse and in the front office. The talent is there, we just need guys to help unlock it. As far as the playoffs are concerned, I'll be rooting for a Brewers-Mariners matchup in the World Series, with the Mariners winning the whole thing. It's fun seeing a city win their first World Series and I'd love to see Mariners fans finally get their first chip. [Philadelphia Phillies](#f/PHI)Phillies By /u/toastiify The Phillies have continued to do what they've done under Dave Dombrowski, improving their win total steadily each year. They've now made the play offs in four straight seasons and have won back to back NL East titles. The story this year was Kyle Schwarber's continued improvement as a hitter finishing just short of Ryan Howard's record of 58 home runs. The other story was Cristopher Sanchez only being out-pitched by Paul Skenes in the National League. The Phillies were battling the Mets into the summer, but their paths diverged at the trade deadline when the Phillies acquired Harrison Bader and Jhoan Duran. Duran was as advertised and Bader exceeded any expectations fans had of him. The Phillies go into the post-season as the slight favorites to win it all. The pitching staff is a bit more questionable with the absence of Zack Wheeler, but they should be as good as anyone in the league. The tipping point is the lineup who could easily carry the team to the World Series or go cold and be eliminated in the first round. It's make or break for the Phillies this year as Ranger Suarez, Kyle Schwarber, and JT Realmuto are all free agents at the end of the year.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nttpq0/2025_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_28_special/ngwhlqv/,2025-09-29T21:40:49+00:00,Red Sox,6028

reddit_comment,baseball,kasutori_Jack,"##American League East End of Season Write-Ups [Baltimore Orioles](#f/BAL) Orioles By /u/gibtafssa To call this years Orioles season disappointing is an understatement. Coming off a couple of playoff seasons, to finish under .500 and in last place, the team took a major step back. Here are some of the questions going into the off-season. - Who can they sign and where would they put them? - Will Grayson Rodriguez ever pitch again? - Who is going to be the new manager? - Who is going to be the new GM? - What do they do with Adley? - Realistic expectations moving forward? So as far as signing free agents, there really isn’t any room. Take a look at the projected roster (starters) next year position wise. C – Rutschman/Basallo 1B – Mayo 2B – Holliday 3B – Westburg SS – Henderson LF – O’Neill CF – Cowser RF – Beavers DH – Rutschman/Basallo So where is there room for someone to come in? Sure, there is need for a veteran presence, but these young guys have the positions pretty much locked down. There could be some trades made for pitching (which is what they should have done with Kjerstad before last year started), but Elias loves prospects and young players. So, I don’t see any huge moves coming on the position player side, which is unfortunate because the offense disappeared in September. Pitching wise they need at least 3 starters and 4 relievers. The bullpen needs an entire overhaul so we will see what moves can be made. Speaking of pitching, will Grayson Rodriguez pitch again? My guess is no. The guy hasn’t pitched in almost two years and they can’t really specify his injury, which is more concerning. Odds are if he does come back, it will be as a bullpen piece only, big loss for a guy that was supposed to anchor your rotation for years. This team needs a manager that holds players and coaches accountable. I really want to see Mark DeRosa get off TV and get into the Orioles dugout. I don’t think that will happen, but we can dream. Brad Ausmus might be available, Skip Schumaker is out there and Orioles fans would love to see Ryan Flaherty come back to manage. I would hope the Orioles get someone who has experience and also commands the respect from the room. The Orioles need a new GM because they “secretly” promoted Mike Elias before the season started. He is now the President of Baseball Ops. This will be interesting, because if it is someone who already works with the team and was under Elias, then things won’t change all that much. If they go outside the organization and get someone new, then maybe the philosophy will skew a bit from what it has been over the past 6 years. Either way the new person will be extremely busy from jump. What do you do with Adley? Injuries and a down year did not help him, neither did the extension for Basallo, who will be with the team for basically the next decade. Do you slot him in as DH when Basallo catches? Do you still want him as a catcher? If you trade him, you are trading him at the lowest possible value. Drafting a catcher at 1-1 is always a gamble and usually never works out. He just hasn’t lived up to the hype, whether that is fair or not. Hmm where have I heard that about an Orioles catcher before (see Matt Weiters). My guess is he splits time with Basallo at catcher this year and DH’s the other half and then might be traded next off-season. Realistic expectations for this team are all dependent on the leadership coming in and moves that are made. If they upgrade the bullpen and get a manager who can lead young players then the team can clearly make the playoffs. If they bargain bin shop and get someone who will just do what the Front Office wants then we could see another season like this one. [New York Yankees](#f/NYY) Yankees By /u/gamedemon24 Last year I wrote a vivid hype fanfic for this. This year I’m just gonna air some grievances against the little brothers. All in good spirits of course. It’s heel time bitches. Almost a year removed from the Soto sweepstakes, I still really wish we could’ve offered Soto a playoff contending team. But I mean, how do you beat Steve Cohen’s pitch? He’s serious about winning, and it really showed this year. The ‘25 Mets were exactly the type of team I was hoping Juan would get: one we wouldn’t be watching in the wild card round. To the Dodgers, we’re coming at you Nestor-less and ready for revenge. We don’t want to be the ones to send Kershaw packing on a low note (he’s my favorite pitcher of all time, I really don’t), but we will. You better hope Aaron Boone doesn’t use Devin Williams for high-leverage. Or more accurately, we better hope. And the Astros! I hope their fans enjoyed their time as America’s most hated team. It was nice to let them try on the crown, but it’s time to let the real villains shine again. Remaining most hated after the playoffs is something only the Yankees can do (not that we have to this year). Alas, the dynasty is over and the Houston faithful finally have the results to match inferiority complex. Finally, the Red Sox…you’re still here? That’s cool I guess, you have a good track record against us in the playoffs lately. I guess I just expected Tampa Bay to be the one to drag a middling, dysfunctional mediocre roster into exhausted overachievement, it’s kinda their thing. But you make a decent Washington Generals to our Globetrotters, so I suppose we can play you off.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nttpq0/2025_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_28_special/ngwd0ji/,2025-09-29T21:17:13+00:00,Red Sox,5374

reddit_comment,baseball,kasutori_Jack,"##American League Central End of Season Write-Ups [Chicago Whitesox](#f/CWS) White Sox By: /u/kristusv Let's look at what the situation looked like to start the season. The White Sox had exactly 4 players from the 2024 opening day roster coming back to start the season. Andrew Vaughn is gone, Luis Robert was done for the season at the beginning of September, Korey Lee was overtaken by two younger, better catchers and Benintendi has been...an average hitter and atrocious defender. I wrote that the roster was worse on paper than last year and that was largely true. What turned out to be the difference is that rookie call ups turned out to be...not terrible! The 3 team leaders in fWAR on the hitting side are all rookies. Fangraphs had projected the bullpen to be one of the worst in modern history, with negative fWAR. They were actually in the top half of the league, although that very likely comes from pitching just about the most innings in the league this year. The starting pitching was pretty mid this year, although that comes from being a very young core that did not pitch deep into games. It would have been really nice to not lose 100 games this year and it looked like there was a real shot after the young hitters came out the second half blazing, but they faltered down the stretch. It's understandable with such a young team playing the longest seasons of their lives, but still frustrating. There are a lot of young players to be excited about. Colson Montgomery holds a fun stat. His first home was July 22nd and he now holds the record for most homers in a season where a player had 0 at the all star break, eclipsing Gary Sanchez's massive 2016 second half. Lenyn Sosa has a fun story. He was a propsect who came out of nowhere in 2022 to have a big minor league season. When the White Sox started his clock in 2022 by calling him up, Tony La Russa opted to give Leury Garcia, the worst player in baseball at the time at bats instead of Lenyn. Lenyn finished this year as an average bat, but had a big second half, and specifically the month after the all star break, OPS'd nearly 900 while learning 1B on the fly. Kyle Teel looks like the real deal. He's a good defensive catcher who walks, gets on base and hits for power. Even Miguel Vargas has looked like a real piece after looking terrible in the half season with the White Sox last year. This team has a lot of holes that will need to be filled in FA if they want to look any better next year, but they have what looks like a solid core. [Minnesota Twins](#f/MIN)Twins By /u/antithesys Byron Buxton is finally healthy, and when he is healthy he is a fantastic, exciting player all around. That's a positive. He wants to stay, too, for some reason, so we can keep watching him. That's a positive, at least for us. Let's see, what other positives can we take away from this year...there's, um...well...okay, there's nothing else in the win column. So why will we be back next year? Is it because we're hopelessly stupid? No. It's because we're human, and humans are optimistic, and hopeful beyond all reason. The sun will rise on a new day. It always has. Every single time, the night has ended. Even if some nights are longer than others. [Kansas City Royals](#f/KCR) Royals By: /u/mozilla_fennekin Reasons why the Royals disappointed: Bobby's offensive production dropped by 39 wRC+, Jonathan India was forced to be a multi-positional guy, Salvy had a below average season despite 30 HR / 100 RBIs, and there was a general lack of improvement internally especially with guys like MJ Melendez and Drew Waters. And that's just the hitting; Ragans was out for most of the season, Lugo was inconsistent and Michael Lorenzen wasn't an improvement over Brady Singer. Reasons why the Royals were actually pretty good and this season can still be seen as a very slight success while promising that 2026 will be a banger year: Bobby was still a top-10 player in WAR because he is literally that good, the highly anticipated Maikel Garcia breakout happened, and trickle down Lugonomics have proven to be effective long-term. Noah Cameron would get ROTY in some years and the Bergert + Kolek duo has already proven to be a worthwhile exchange for the Ferminator. By the way, most Royals fans are rooting for the Padres now. Also, Carlos Estevez led baseball in saves. And we can't forget the OTHER highly anticipated breakout of Kris Bubic! KC has become a pitching factory practically overnight and we're all just as surprised as anyone. This was an odd year with a lot of growing pains and lessons to be learned, but if they're taken to heart then the Royals should have an exciting off-season with a revamped lineup going into 2026 on top of an already top-tier pitching staff. One of my favorite things about GMJJ is that he doesn't repeat mistakes. Last off-season was too passive, but now it's clear what needs to be done. The World Cup will be across the parking lot next year, let's make it the best summer ever.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nttpq0/2025_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_28_special/ngwc1rn/,2025-09-29T21:12:19+00:00,Red Sox,4994
reddit_comment,baseball,kasutori_Jack,"##National League Central End of Season Write-Ups [Pitsburgh Pirates](#f/PIT)Pirates By /u/thecaptainandking The postseason is here again, and once again the Pirates will be watching from the couch. With the Cubs and Reds reaching the postseason this year, every NL Central team has reached the playoffs multiple since Ben Cherington was hired by the Pirates except, of course, of the Pirates. In 6 years under Cherington, the Pirates have never won more than 76 games or finished higher than fourth place. After losing more games than last year despite employing the future Cy Young winner Paul Skenes, Cherington will apparently be back for a 7th crack at .500 in Pittsburgh. Despite having Skenes and top prospect Konnor Griffin, I am not optimistic. Ben's track record speaks for itself. [Milwaukee Brewers](#f/MIL)Brewers By /u/kc9kvu The Brewers have the best record in baseball and in franchise history. They’re top 3 in the league on both sides of the ball. They got multiple bullpen pieces back just in time for the playoffs. By all accounts, this is the best Brewers team of my life, and a team poised for a deep playoff run. But as Milwaukee has been reminded five times in the last six years, nothing is guaranteed in October. While their 5 consecutive playoff series losses might not tell us anything about the future, it is a haunting reminder of just how fast a promising season can end. And while every path to the World Series is uphill, the Brewers might have it the hardest of any team who has earned a bye. The Padres had an incredible trade deadline and have been one of the best teams in baseball, and the Cubs have been a strong team all season as well. In the regular season, the Brewers only lost the season series to 4 NL teams, and only 2 of them made the playoffs. They will face one of those 2 in the division series. If they manage to win their first playoff series since 2018, their most likely opponent in the championship series would be the Phillies with the second best record in baseball and, in my opinion, likely the easier of the NL division series opponents. No matter what happens in October, this team has been so incredibly fun to watch, and I don’t think I could call the season a failure no matter how it ends. Looking further ahead, many key players are locked down for years to come, and more top prospects are on the way. But we’ve taken enough bites at the apple already, it’s time to take the whole thing. [St Louis Cardinals](#f/STL)Cardinals By /u/returnof_thehack How the NL Central ended up with 3 teams in the playoffs is beyond me. I was told this was the worst division of all time. Nonetheless, Brewers-Mariners is the World Series we all deserve, but not the one we will get right now.

The Guardians leaned on their bullpen, last year. The starters averaged 4-5 inning starts, largely. The bullpen took over and had a historic season lead by three rookies. Hard to repeat, and we didn’t. The starters flipped their mindset mid season (likely because Vogt started to trust them) and started going 6-7 innings. It paid off. For the media prognosticators, they probably didn’t see us replicating the year from the bullpen we had. (It was still great, by the way.) However, they also didn’t account for our starters to pick up the slack. 2. We traded our second best hitter. Josh Naylor, lowish average but 30hr and 100rbi. Beyond that, he was our fire and energy. We couldn’t replace that fire, but Kyle Manzardo did his best to replace the production. While we didn’t have as many baserunners to give Kyle the RBI’s, he hit 27hr in just his second year. We also traded Andrés Giménez. Had a bad year last season at bat, but was capable. He was, also, our best fielder; a perennial Gold Glover and has won the Platinum Glove. It was a necessary move based on payroll. Thankfully, Brayan Rocchio was up to the task, defensively. The batting platoon was not better, but fine. 3. Two big bats last season and playoffs were Lane Thomas and David Fry. They were not available preseason. Thomas played sparingly and got injured again. Fry came back later and couldn’t field because of Tommy John. He was at limited use. Thomas was our two hole and Fry was to be between 5-6. It didn’t work out that way. You top that off with our ace, Shane Bieber, out, it looks bad (traded before he made a start for us). Our call ups from AAA either out performed or showed us the future. Finally, and maybe this is nothing, but Guardians fans are, actually, full of positivity. In the city, it’s the most fun stadium to be in. We can boo, but we mostly cheer. We were down, but not out. It didn’t matter. There was no pressure on the team. José Ramiírez was breaking a ton of team records this year. That was fun enough. Everyone was just relaxed.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nvulc3/preseason_rankings_vs_playoffs/nhbgjrw/,2025-10-02T05:36:19+00:00,Mets,2190

reddit_post,baseball,KimHaSeongsBurner,"Wild Card teams who lose Game 1 are 2-18, but those who win Game 2 are 2-2 By my quick math and Googling, there have been 20 Wild Card series to date between 2020 (8 due to expanded COVID playoffs) and each of 2022, 2023, and 2024 (4 each) entering 2025. In those 20 series, teams who won Game 1 went on to win the series 18 of the 20 times, with both exceptions being the 2020 Cardinals (lost to the Padres after leading 1-0) and 2020 White Sox (lost to the Athletics after leading 1-0). This stat is touted as “lose Game 1, lose the series”, but what about teams who win Game 2? How often does a team lose Game 1 but win Game 2, and how often does that team win Game 3? It turns out that leveling the series brings your odds back to a coin toss. Only 4 WC series to date, prior to 2025, have gone to 3 games. The 2020 Athletics and Padres both won after losing Game 1, but the 2022 Padres staved off a Mets series comeback to win Games 1 and 3, as did those same Mets in 2024 against the Brewers. So, losing Game 1 causes your series odds to plummet simply because 90% of the time that team has dropped Game 2. Through three games played today, we have three Game 3’s confirmed for tomorrow, where history tells us those odds go back to 50%.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nvqgx8/wild_card_teams_who_lose_game_1_are_218_but_those/,2025-10-02T01:20:59+00:00,Mets,1243

reddit_comment,baseball,Litejedi,"By ""value"" lost, the Mets suffered the 4th most dollar values lost due to injury, in baseball, numerically (not as a percentage of payroll). Not sure about WAR. This is not an excuse, because - obviously, as a random person on the internet, I'm not in a position to make excuses, since I wasn't involved in any decisionmaking. But it is an explanation for anyone who cares to read. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Almost all of the ""value"" lost was lost pitchers. And arguably, when pitchers came back from injury, they struggled immensely. At the start of the season they had 10 starting pitchers on their 40-man roster. For each player I'll note their status at the start of the season, and anything that happened later. Sean Manea - Injured in Spring Training, came back July 13th from injury but had ongoing fatigue and control issues. Played through ""loose bodies"" in his elbow, which seem to cause him pain with every throw. Frankie Montas - Injured in Spring Training, had a poor performance, eventually transferred to IL again for season-ending TJ surgery. Christian Scott - Recovering from a September TJ surgery. Never pitched. Paul Blackburn - Recovering from a cerebrospinal fluid leak, he also suffered right knee inflammation. Came into the season June 2nd, but fell apart from July, and then had shoulder impingment and landed on the IL again until August. He was later DFA'd and picked up by the yankees. Kodai Senga - Active, suffered a strained hamstring in June, returned in July and lost most of his ""stuff"". Showed obvious fatigue, eventually voluntarily went down to the minors but was unable to come back to the majors before the season ended. Griffing Canning - Active, until he suffered a seasoning-ending ruptured achilles (I was at the game! It was horrible!) on June 26th, season ended. Tylor Megill - Active, until June 17th when he was put on the IL with a right elbow strain, and had season ending TJ surgery. David Peterson - Active, no injuries to speak of, but lost command and velocity over the season because he was the only pitcher doing extended innings. Clay Holmes - Active, no injuries They had 9 Relief Pitchers: Drew Smith - Recovering from July 2024 TJ surgery, didn't pitch Dedniel Nunez - Recovering from a flexor injury, pitched in 10 appearances, suffered season-ending injury leading to TJ surgery July 3rd Edwin Diaz - Active, no injuries (yay for Sugar) A.J. Minter - Active, suffered a season-ending lat injury in april. Ryne Stanek - Active, no injuries Jose Butto - Active, suffered an illness in the month of July, traded to the Giants. Danny Young - Active, in May had season-ending TJ surgery Max Kranick - Active, in June, had season-ending flexor tendor surgery, it was determined he'd need a second TJ surgery Huascar Brazoban - Active, no injuries Reed Garrett - Active, in August suffered from elbow inflammation, which escalated to season-ending TJ surgery.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nt8iak/which_teams_collapse_was_the_worst_astros_mets_or/ngs83x1/,2025-09-29T05:57:06+00:00,Mets,2975

It was apparent that the rotation was going to be an issue at the deadline, and while people liked their other moves and it’s not clear how many options for SP were out there, they did nothing to remedy the situation. By the Marlins series, Mendoza had basically no one he could count on. Then you had some players who just flat out did not play the way they were supposed to, like Rogers or Senga. Then you’ve got core players who are just bad defenders, like Soto and Pete. That’s not Mendoza’s fault. Again, Mendoza deserves a portion of the blame but he showed promise last year and the Mets have had a quick trigger with Rojas and Buck and you don’t want to develop too much of a reputation for that.

reddit_comment,baseball,Redbubble89,"Your roster construction reminded me of the Red Sox for the past 2-3 years with a better offense. In both cases, they would get to the break and the workload of pitching got them. I saw the Mets still getting in but the lack of top rotation talent was somehow not a priority. It doesn't have to be Garrett Crochet but a solid 1 starter stops a 3 game losing streak from being a 4 or 5 or 6 or 7. They had several of them where they wouldn't win for a week plus. The way the roster was constructed was not for 162. This is going to suck but don't resign Alonso and move the money to pitching. As much as a fan favorite he is, Bieber, King, whatever, is going to make them better than bringing back a 1st basemen. They don't throw $1 billion at free agents and then have 3 young kids as their starter depth. I questioned this roster back in March and it seemed like other Mets fans said the same thing about the pitching. I would also fire Mendoza as he didn't seem prepared for this.",https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1nt1ti6/the_new_york_mets_will_not_be_making_the/ngqgvh9/,2025-09-28T23:00:49+00:00,Mets,982

reddit_post,mlb,xcmets,"The Institutional Loser Theory *Disclaimer: This is a theory I have been sitting on for over a year. Now that we are in the midst of the post season and once again, the Mets are devoid of a championship, it seems like an appropriate time to share. I developed this concept independently of any outside sources. It is highly probable that one or more parties in the past have articulated this in some fashion and, if this is the case, I merely offer my personal hypothesis.* The Institutional Loser Theory Sports, like women, will rip your heart out. No team is protected against it and that is why we love it. The unpredictability yet familiarity of it all. The glory of victory, agony of defeat and all the other cliches you want to throw around. However, if you watch long enough, the ‘agony of defeat’ part tends to find certain teams more often than others. Teams will have streaks, ruts, playoff droughts; but this isn’t about your run of the mill bad luck. No, this is a concept that is far more chronic, more rooted, and more devastating. This is what I’ve come to refer to as a team that is an Institutional Loser. What is an Institutional Loser? This is not a term with a hard and fast definition. It cannot be quantified with wins and losses (although these statistics often go hand-in-hand). There is no single determining factor that can be found in a box score. No particular number of years missing the post-season can be attributed to the organization nor can a set number of championships. Instead, one must examine the very *nature* of the franchise itself. An Institutional Loser is a team who, at its basic level, has been corrupted; its DNA wrought with agony and pain. They are experts at weaving intricate tapestries of suffering for the world to gawk at. It is an organization who, historically, cannot get out of its own way, *even if they do everything right*. An Institutional Loser can change its players, management, or owner, but the results remain constant. It is as if forces beyond our understanding or control, from above or below, are exerting their otherworldly wills upon these God-forsaken teams at the expense of all that is natural and orderly. It is the very make-up of the franchise itself, at the molecular level, that cements its status of an Institutional Loser. Take the New York Mets as an example. The Mets are Institutional Losers. They held the record of most losses in an MLB season from their first year of existence in 1962 until 2024. They are architects of disaster, building cathedrals of sadness for their mourning parishioners. They make the wrong decisions every step of the way, whether it’s letting up all-time great players like Tom Seaver, blowing a seven-game divisional lead with seventeen games to play or being collateral damage of the Madoff scandal. There are far too many examples to specifically name, nor is that the purpose of this because you do not need such examples. One of the hallmarks of an Institutional Loser is that you know it when you see it. Finding creative ways to lose is what the Mets do. They are quintessential Institutional Losers. Even when they make the right moves: signing the best available players, assembling a team loaded with all-star talent, incredible win streaks, they cannot get out of their way because the very fabric of the team is that of an Institutional Loser. **A team can even win a championship and remain Institutional Losers.** Through ownership changes, managerial changes, player changes, philosophical changes, they are Institutional Losers. How does a team become an Institutional Loser? There are a number of ways by which this manifests itself. One example is the Mets’ inaugural season of 120 losses. The Mets were born into a futile existence, baptized in the fire of failure. If a team is not born as an Institutional Loser, they might be conceived as one. The Seattle Mariners are a prime illustration of an Institutional Loser conceived in the den of chaos. A further examination of this by the brilliant Jon Bois can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIgK56cAjfY), but again, examples are unnecessary if you have been paying attention because you know an Institutional Loser when you see one. A team that has had undoubtably great instances of success, but ultimately falls short inexplicably because at their core, are Institutional Losers. A final category that an Institutional Loser might find itself in is the ‘cursed’ franchise. Historically speaking, the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs are the ideal specimen. Literally cursed for decades, the preternatural losing done by these teams who had some of the greatest players of the twentieth century confirms the otherworldly nature of being an Institutional Loser. It is beyond natural. Innocent people who never hurt a soul, lived their entire lives and died, without witnessing these teams win a championship. The supernatural effect of this losing goes beyond any ‘normal’ losing that a franchise might endure. Institutional Losers do not exist in baseball solely. Such paranormal forces do not care for the lines of demarcation we mortals have defined as ‘sport;’ being an Institutional Loser cuts across disciplines. The Cleveland Browns, Minnesota Vikings (once again, Jon Bois has an expertly crafted video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRhFEGREiac)), and New York Jets are clear examples in the NFL. Search other sports and you will find similar cases. The same rules apply in that there are no rules. Just chaos followed by the inevitable crushing disappointment all those associated with the team feel year after agonizing year. At this point, despondent fans might be wondering how such a team can break the cycle of ineptitude. What causes teams to move from the realm of Institutional Loser to what can be referred to as a ‘regular team.’ Unfortunately, there is no quantifiable measure to escape this standard of misery. However, just as is the case with being an Institutional Loser, if a team is lucky enough to break free of the shackles of wretchedness, you will know it when you see it as something supernatural must have happened. Again, the lifted curses of the Red Sox and Cubs are examples of this. The demons that had plagued these teams for so long had been exercised in a moment of tremendous release that was a phenomenon *felt* by those who experienced it. To be freed from such an existence, a supernatural occurrence orders of magnitude larger than anything experienced in fandom can elevate a cursed franchise to ‘regular team’ status with the jovial, care-free ups and downs expected of a professional sports team. One might dispute this theory and use the Jets as a case study. They have won a championship and have since been to the playoffs. It is at this junction that we must revisit the fact that there is no quantifiable number of wins and losses that define an Institutional Loser. Instead, one must look at the entire history of the organization and use a holistic approach. You know it when you see it. The Jets cannot get out of their own way. The Jets find creative ways to lose. The foundation of the Jets is stained with misery. The Jets are Institutional Losers. One of the hallmarks of Institutional Losers is that they *do* have moments of hope and instances of glory because when such teams get so very close to sustained success, Institutional Losers will inevitably crush every last granule of optimism in a way that is unique in both creativity and pain. “If something supernatural needs to happen to end a team’s status as Institutional Losers, what about Game 6?” When Mookie Wilson’s slow roller to first slipped beneath the glove of Bill Buckner, forcing a Game 7 in the 1986 World Series, leading to the Mets second ever World Series Championship, forces beyond our comprehension were at play. However, this did not terminate the Mets’ status as Institutional Losers. This is because the forces at play did not help bolster the Mets; that was merely a byproduct. Instead, the supernatural state of the game served to *hurt* the Red Sox. Their curse, a far more ancient stench than that of the Mets misfortunes, reared its ugly head to force the pain to continue for the Red Sox. The Mets just happened to be a byproduct of that situation; rare recipients of a moment of good luck. What should have been a late 1980s dynasty for the Mets ended with a whimper because they still remained Institutional Losers. Again, it must be understood that teams can win one or more championships and still remain Institutional Losers. That is the ‘institutional’ part of the term. The team cannot get out of their own way. The team finds creative ways to lose. The team offers fans misery and heartbreak. The team is flawed. The team is an Institutional Loser. If there are teams that are Institutional Losers, are there teams that are Institutional Winners? The answer is a resounding, ‘yes.’ Much like Institutional Losers, Institutional Winners are not quantifiable, but you know them when you see them. Their qualities, though similar in their supernaturality to Institutional Losers, are completely inverted beyond that. They find success. They make the right moves. They make the wrong moves and those moves turn out to be right anyway. The New York Yankees are Institutional Winners. The St. Louis Cardinals are Institutional Winners. Much like the inverse of Institutional Losers, Institutional Winners can go years without winning championships. The New York Yankees won a championship in 2009 and have not won another one since. It does not matter; they are always in the conversation. They make the playoffs regularly. There is an expectation of success. Even in down seasons, with droughts lasting a few years, Institutional Winners still have forces beyond our comprehension nudging such franchises towards success. Only with equal seismic shifts in fates might an Institutional Winner fall from grace to join regular teams. Most organizations are regular teams. They have their highs. They have their lows. They might win several championships in a row. They might miss the post season for a decade. Much like Institutional Losers and Institutional Winners, there is no quantifiable amount of winning or losing that happens to make a team a regular team. Some teams are bad. Some teams are good. That’s the way sports are and that is why we love them. But sometimes, the losing goes too far. Sometimes the misfortune is too great. Sometimes, the sickness of an organization is too severe. The condition that presents itself is beyond what any prescription can cure. The lamentations of the fanbases ring loud but reach the ears of no one who hears or more importantly, who cares to change the pitiful condition of the team. The team is utterly flawed. The team is utterly broken. The team is an Institutional Loser.",https://reddit.com/r/mlb/comments/1nwaz68/the_institutional_loser_theory/,2025-10-02T17:57:52+00:00,Yankees,10880

reddit_comment,mlb,magicearsknubbler,"I didn’t like playing Grisham either, but sitting him makes the outfield harder to fill. Wells over Rice because Wells is the better catcher. Also, Rice has only caught Fried once all year and they need the best battery they can get. Rosario over Jazz because Rosario has made a career out of hitting lefties, and entered that game like 6/9 against Crochet. Goldschmidt is not the fastest guy but is a very smart baserunner, and the only realistic pinch runner is Jasson Dominguez.

reddit_comment,mlb,Old_Willow4766,Just a ton of flawed logic here. 1. Goldschmidt was no the tying run. Lets say you pinch run and the placement scores and the remaining hitters do the exact same thing. Congrats you lost 3-2 instead of 3-1. 2. You're replacing Rice with Goldschmidt who has a .981 OPS against lefties and had 2 hits in the game. That decision objectively worked. 3. You replaced Chisolm with Rosario would has an .819 OPS against lefties 4. Grishman is really your only viable option in CF with. If you remove Grisham you have to play Jasson Dominguez in one of the outfield spots and he had a .569 OPS against lefties this year. 5. You take the trade in Wells vs Rice to get better defense behind home plate. I'm a Sox fan who would love to dunk on Boone at any turn but his lineup decisions were sound in process.

reddit_post,mlb,adamj495,"Judge vs. Raleigh: A Mostly Unbiased Breakdown of the AL MVP Race I still remember the first time I watched **Ichiro take the field in 2001**. As a fan in Seattle, you could feel right away this was not just another rookie. Every at-bat was an event, and every throw from right field seemed like a frozen rope with a chance to cut down even the fastest runners at third. Ichiro did not win MVP because of a single stat like WAR. He won because he changed the way the game felt. [Statistically, he ranked sixth in the AL in Wins Above Replacement with a 6.0 batting FWAR](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2001.shtml) (7.7 batting and defense). If I had a vote that year and focused only on the numbers, I probably would have leaned toward Jason Giambi, who led the league in WAR, on-base percentage by a wide margin, slugging, and OPS. But there was more to the story. Oakland reached the playoffs as a wild card, while Seattle broke the all-time wins record with 116. Ichiro brought energy, style, and a draw unlike anyone else, helping the Mariners lead the majors in attendance at over 43,000 fans per game. The electricity in the ballpark was real, and it was not just about one stat line. The award ultimately went to the player who lifted not only Seattle but also the country of Japan to new heights in Major League Baseball. Looking simply at FWAR, if you take away Ichiro’s 7.7 and replace him with a minor leaguer, the stat would suggest the Mariners could have still easily made the playoffs that season with 108 wins. But witnessing it all in person, Ichiro elevated an entire team of mostly misfits [projected to finish 3rd in the AL West (out of 4 back then) by ESPN](https://www.espn.com/mlb/2001/0326/1162285.html). I do not think they would have been a playoff team without him. His impact went far beyond the numbers and the record books. # Full Disclosure - Unconscious Bias Unconscious bias refers to the automatic and unintentional mental shortcuts that influence our judgments, decisions, and actions without our conscious awareness. I grew up a Seattle Mariners fan, but I owned more Yankees hats than any other team. The Mariners have always been my favorite team, and the Yankees are my second favorite. As a kid, my parents would ship my brother and me off to visit my Grandma, Grandpa, Aunt, Uncle, and cousins in New York twice a year. Both of my parents grew up in New York, and I always felt like I had a little New York in me. I carried a strong sense of New York pride. I would tell my friends that the pizza and bagels in New York are so much better than Seattle’s, and I would brag about the Yankees’ 27 World Series titles. I was thrilled when A-Rod joined the Yankees because it felt like he was coming back to one of my teams. I am primarily a Mariners fan, but I was cheating with the enemy. The 2025 AL MVP comes down to New York’s Aaron Judge and Seattle’s Cal Raleigh, two players who have put up historic but very different seasons. The debate is simply, who is the most valuable player. Below is a side by side comparison of Cal Raleigh vs Aaron Judge, you can find in our [Player Comparison Tool.](https://www.grandsalamitime.com/player-stats-comparison) [Player Comparison Tool](https://www.grandsalamitime.com/player-stats-comparison) # Aaron Judge’s Case If I had a vote, which I do not (Ryan Divish, please consider me for BBWAA membership), I would vote for Aaron Judge if I cared primarily about offensive production. In 2025, Judge was simply the best hitter in baseball. Judge represents the classic MVP profile: * **Elite offensive efficiency**: He leads the league in batting average (.331), OPS (1.149), and several advanced metrics including batting WAR (10.1). * **Plays for a big market team**: MVP candidates often come from teams in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, or Chicago. While this is partly because many of the best players happen to play there, media coverage may also play a role. For example, in 2020, Jose Abreu won the AL MVP despite being third in FWAR behind two players on division-leading Cleveland. * **Main contributor on a playoff team:** “Most valuable” often implies the player who is most important to a playoff team, similar to how Judge is the centerpiece of the Yankees. At the same time, there are cases where the best player in baseball wins MVP even without reaching the postseason, as Shohei Ohtani did with the Angels in 2021 and 2023. Judge’s main drawback is that he plays a less demanding defensive position, so his value is almost entirely tied to his batting. # Cal Raleigh’s Case Raleigh has forced his way into the conversation by making history. * **Unprecedented power:** Hitting 60 home runs as a catcher is something baseball has never seen. Sixty homers is one of the game’s greatest milestones, no matter the position, and Raleigh reaching it at catcher makes it historic.**Positional weight:** He is doing this while managing one of the most demanding defensive jobs in the sport. Last year’s Platinum Glove winner is still among the game’s best behind the plate, all while producing at an elite level offensively.**Narrative impact:** Record-breaking seasons often resonate strongly with voters, and Raleigh’s switch-hitting power from the catcher position is unlike anything before it. Judge, by contrast, has already been recognized with multiple MVPs, and voter fatigue is a very real bias that can make repeat winners face an uphill climb.**Stadium factor:** Raleigh plays in one of the most pitcher-friendly parks in baseball, making his power even more impressive. If he played his home games at Yankee Stadium, our [projections suggest he would have about five additional home runs, which would put him past Judge’s single-season record of 62 (despite baseball savant’s calculations suggesting he would have less HR in Yankee Stadium)](https://www.grandsalamitime.com/the-grand-salami-times/cal-hr-playing-at-yankee-stadium-judge) Image below is from Baseball Savant, which I believe does a great job visualizing and explaining the impact of a stadium (unlike baseball savant’s xHR which seems to show different results): [https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/statcast-park-factors](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/statcast-park-factors) Seattle has an 89 in Hits and 92 in HR (100 being average), while yankee stadium has a 94 in Hits and 119 in HR. I know the math doesn’t work perfectly this way, but imagine if Cal Raleigh added 94/89 = 5.6% divided by 2 = 2.8% (half the games) more hits AND had an additional 5 more HR from our [Statcast analysis](https://www.grandsalamitime.com/the-grand-salami-times/cal-hr-playing-at-yankee-stadium-judge). Then Cal would have ended the season with a .253 Batting average and 65 HR if he played half his games at Yankee Stadium. If he played in NY for 1/2 his games in Seattle, i have his OPS estimated at .992… Quite a bit better, **but still a ways from Judge’s 1.149.** **Division Winner:** Winning a division and getting the 2nd seed bye is a bigger achievement than making the playoffs with a wild card spot. If playoff positioning is a factor, Cal gets the slight edge. # The Verdict Raleigh may be trailing Judge in some of the key hitting statistics, but he makes up for it with his power, defense, and leadership (helping bring the Seattle Mariners an AL Division Title for the first time since 2001). [The fact that Cal Raleigh’s salary is so affordable ($17.5M/year for 6 years) gave the Mariners the ability to sign key additions like Naylor and Suarez.](https://www.grandsalamitime.com/the-grand-salami-times/lets-sign-naylor-and-arozarena-now) Salary is not something ever considered in an MVP discussion but Cal Raleigh is getting paid $1.9M per Win above Replacement ($17.5M 2025 salary/9.1 WAR). In comparison Aaron Judge’s 2025 salary was $40M. With a WAR of 10.1, the Yankees are paying him $4.0M for every win above replacement (40M/10.1). This might sound silly, but the value of Cal Raleigh’s contract is valuable. The **mariners are paying better than 1/2 the price per win above replacement for Cal, compared to Judge**. If you are talking who is the most valuable player in the American League? It is not simply the player who put up the best offensive stats. Aaron Judge is the clear winner of the Hank Aaron Award. He might even be the winner of the AL MVP. All I am saying is that there is a very strong case that if we are talking about who is the most “valuable” player in baseball, instead of who is the best player in baseball…. Cal Raleigh might be the right choice. Witnessing it locally firsthand, if I had a vote (which I do not), I would cast it for Cal Raleigh because of all the intangibles. However, if I were a voter who wasn’t watching the Mariners every night or writing weekly analytical deep dives about them, I would probably vote for Judge based on the stats. Judge clearly had a better statistical season and there is no denying that. Let me know your thoughts in the comments: Will Cal win the MVP?

The window is closing on this current group. What better way to go out?” **Sam Blum (SEA):** “The Mariners have an underrated resume for one of the snakebitten franchise in baseball. They haven’t even played in a World Series. If there’s any team to get it done, this feels like the team. That city will be rocking in October. Colleague Chad Jennings [roasted me](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6222015/2025/03/24/mlb-predictions-2025-world-series/) in March for picking the M’s. I’m looking forward to the apology, Chadwick.” **Chad Jennings (PHI):** “Am I picking this team so that my friend John won’t yell at me? Maybe. But I really think the Phillies have the best blend of high-impact stars and reliable role players, and I trust them to make plays, throws strikes, put together at-bats, and hit three-run homers. The pitching scares me a little bit, but that’s true of every postseason team. Each playoff pitching staff seems fatally flawed, yet one of them has to survive to the end. Why not this one? ” **Andy McCullough (LAD):** “Shohei Ohtani. Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Freddie Freeman. Do I need to keep going? OK. Blake Snell. Mookie Betts. Did I mention Ohtani? They’ve got a lot of good players.” **Eno Sarris (SEA):** “‘Why not just win the whole f—ing thing?’ asked Cal Raleigh. Indeed, why not. With their trade deadline reinforcements in, this team has few holes. Starting pitching that can be dominant, a bullpen that was top three in ERA in September, and power from sources other than Julio Rodríguez and Raleigh — these are the reasons the Mariners will finally get to the mountaintop.” **Melissa Lockard (NYY):** “In a weird way, the Yankees almost seem like underdogs given how much focus teams like the Phillies and Mariners have deservedly received. But they have the best hitter in baseball and plenty of other powerful hitters behind him, plus a solid rotation. The bullpen hasn’t looked like it was supposed to after the trade deadline at times but the talent is there and if it clicks, they’d be a very tough team for anyone to beat.”",https://reddit.com/r/mlb/comments/1nufhb8/world_series_predictions_our_experts_pick_the/,2025-09-30T14:58:46+00:00,Yankees,2492

My question is if it happens, and we have a salary cap going forward, what happens to the teams that will definitely be over( Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, and Phillies), they all have multiple players on expensive long term contracts which could keep them over the cap for years. Would they be forced to trade players? Would those contracts be grandfathered in? Either scenario has major drawbacks. If they are forced to trade to the teams under the cap they would get trash back because they have to trade, imagine the Dodgers being forced to trade Mookie to a team like the Pirates. Also if contracts are grandfathered in, those teams will go crazy on spending this offseason knowing they will be able to be over the cap for years.

reddit_post,mlb,LilOpieCunningham,"Do ""vibes"" matter? A history of the AL MVP *or: ""hey look another Judge vs Raleigh post yaaaay""* There's been a lot of talk about Judge vs. Raleigh and awarding the MVP based on ""vibes"" and not on hard stats, so I was wondering how many previous AL MVPs would have led the league in WAR had it been a thing back then, and how many won the MVP after having led the league in at least one Triple Crown category. To put some data to the question: **How often has the MVP been awarded based more on ""vibes"" than on hard stats?** Some up-front notes to start: * This is AL only because I'm lazy and I didn't want to double the work. * This starts at 1950. Why? I dunno, why not? * I know WAR hasn't been a statistic people looked at for as long back as this goes, but it's been calculated so I'm using it. * I'm excluding the (surprisingly frequent) times pitchers have been named MVP in the AL. * Side note: pitching WAR is weird. Denny McLain's 31-win season is tied for the 427th-best WAR season by a pitcher in MLB history. * I looked at WAR (baseball-reference), and the three Triple Crown categories (HR, RBI and AVG) for this. Soooooooo...here we go. **First of all, since 1950 there have been 67 position players awarded the AL MVP. Of those:** * 22 have led the league in WAR. Of those: * 6 did not lead the league in any of the Triple Crown categories * 10 Led in HRs, 8 led in RBI, 8 led in AVG * 7 Led in 2 or more Triple Crown categories, including three triple crown winners * 45 have not led the league in WAR. Of those: * 24 didn't lead the league in any of the Triple Crown categories. * 8 led in HRs, 18 led in RBIs, 4 led in AVG * 8 led in 2 or more Triple Crown categories, including one Triple Crown winner * 9 were New York Yankees, 1 was a Seattle Mariner. In those 9 Yankee MVP seasons where the MVP didn't lead the league in WAR, three times the actual WAR leader was a Yankee (Mickey Mantle got screwed a lot) **Looking specifically at Catchers:** * The AL MVP has been awarded to a catcher 7 times. Yogi Berra (3x), Elston Howard, Thurman Munson, Ivan Rodriguez, Joe Mauer. Of those MVP seasons: * None of them led the league in WAR: * Berra finished 6th (-1.8 from leader, including pitchers), 8th (-2.9), and 11th (-4.0) * Elston Howard finished 7th (-2.2) * Thurman Munson finished 12th (-4.3) * Ivan Rodriguez finished 6th (-3.4) * Joe Mauer finished 3rd (-2.6) * Only one catcher led the league in ANY of the four categories in his MVP season. Joe Mauer led in AVG (2nd in WAR among position players) in 2009 and received 99% of the vote. **Conclusions:** * If history is precedent, it's fair to say that ""vibes"" are absolutely an allowable criterion for MVP selection, particularly when a catcher is involved. If all that mattered for MVP consideration were offensive stats, catchers would be excluded from the MVP conversation. * Monster--even historic--offensive seasons do not automatically equal an MVP (it's no wonder Mantle drank). Often they do (duh), but not always. * ""Devotion"" to WAR has only really been a thing for the last 10 years (reasons should be obvious), where 7 of the last 10 AL MVPs have led the league in WAR. * Of the 30 position player MVPs before 2015, five led the AL in WAR (in large part thanks to Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez) * Who the hell is Zoilo Versalles?",https://reddit.com/r/mlb/comments/1nrcuxr/do_vibes_matter_a_history_of_the_al_mvp/,2025-09-26T20:59:44+00:00,Yankees,3324

reddit_post,mlb,Healthy-Ad6129,"Rockies seriously have to be the worst team of all time Yes I know that the 2024 Chicago White Sox lost two more games to set the modern record. However, their run differential was -306. Still awful, but not nearly as bad as the ‘25 Rockies and their -424. They didn’t score 600 runs, yet gave up over 1,000. That’s insane. If we’re including 19th century teams, their differential ranks 6th all-time in the history of the sport. There’s only a handful of teams from the 20th and the 21st centuries in the top 25, but if we’re only looking at just those teams, it’s the 1932 Red Sox and their -345 that comes closest to this year’s Rockies. I have a hard time giving the worst team ever nod to a team before 1900 because obviously they didn’t have technology, trainers, exercise equipment, major league staffing, every benefit you have these days at your disposal. The game, of course, was way different too. Maybe they get a pass because of the altitude? I don’t know. Maybe some statisticians can “normalize” their numbers to factor in their ballpark. The 2003 Tigers (-337) and 2023 A’s (-339) were pretty bad too.",https://reddit.com/r/mlb/comments/1ntibj2/rockies_seriously_have_to_be_the_worst_team_of/,2025-09-29T13:40:30+00:00,Red Sox,1117

reddit_comment,mlb,staticdresssweet,"Given their not good offense and poor defense as well as the run differential (we know about the pitching obviously), I do believe this is the worst team in MLB history.

Right after this. Pete Alonso opted out of his two year contract with the Mets. I hate to say it as a Mets fan be he could be leaving Queens this December, I believe that he will reunite with Jacob DeGrom and I think that the Texas Rangers will sign him. The reason I think this is due to the Rangers’ improved but underperformed season with .500, which was still an improvement from last year, but it was not enough to match their odds.

reddit_post,mlb,TheSocraticGadfly,"And, the Mets are the second collapse The first, [as I posted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/mlb/comments/1nsegy9/one_collapse_one_collapse_averted_one_potential/), being the Astros. [Now the Mets](https://www.espn.com/mlb/boxscore/_/gameId/401697327). (The Tigers did make the postseason, but losing the division feels like half a collapse.) Although the Mets' implosion doesn't look as bad as Houston's as they were never 15 games over .500, they were 10 over, at 74-64, at the start of September, [per their record](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/2025-schedule-scores.shtml). But, like the Astros, a signature sweep was key to their decline. In their case, the. Phillies' four-game sweep on Sept. 8-11 was huge. After that, they were playing for a wild card, but couldn't even pull that out. OTHER than Alonso on an option year, Starling Marte is the only FA even of halfway note, along with Helsley. But, nobody on the Mets starting rotation makes me jump up. I have no idea if Steve Cohen wants to blow money on a free agent starter or two, along with the CBA tax penalties. (Which paying to keep Alonso will only worsen, even without a FA starter or two.) EDIT: At ESPN, [Passan offers 10 key points](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46402004/mlb-2025-new-york-mets-collapse-disaster-10-moments-eliminated-postseason-playoffs), after noting the Mets played below .500 the last 2/3 of the season.

reddit_post,mlb,TheSocraticGadfly,"One collapse, one collapse averted, one potential collapse (and their future?) That's per [this evening's standings](https://www.espn.com/mlb/standings), and we'll save the first part of the header for the end. The collapse averted is of course the Tigers getting into the postseason. The potential collapse? We'll see how the Mets do tomorrow. The collapse? Per T Rex, the Astros could not [bang a can, get it on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVEhDrJzM8E&list=RDTVEhDrJzM8E&start_radio=1). Part of that is a Mariners surge, yes. But, in late August, the Astros were 15 games above .500 at 75-60. Speaking of, the Mariners sweeping the Astros in Houston Sept. 19-21 was huge. It's like the Astros just collapsed after that. They lost 2 of 3 to the A's, and now the first to the Angels as the second is currently live, but they've been eliminated by the Guardians. They're 10-15 since their peak. I don't know what's all in their future. Yes, Altuve volunteered, but he simply cannot play left field and in any case, the Astros' options this year at 2B were so bad they moved him back. And wound up DHing him more than anything. Is Christian Walker's tail-off this year permanent aging? Will they pay to resign Valdez? If not a full rebuild, I can see management letting Valdez walk and opting for a quick rinse rebuild. The parenthesis is meant about the Astros' future, but, pending what happens tomorrow, one wonders about New York, for that matter.",https://reddit.com/r/mlb/comments/1nsegy9/one_collapse_one_collapse_averted_one_potential/,2025-09-28T03:47:07+00:00,Mets,1454

reddit_comment,mlb,YngSpook84,"The Astros don’t need to rebuild. They had and MLB record setting number of players on the IL this year. Those players combined for a total of 18 WAR that was lost for the team. The only free agents the Astros have this offseason are Framber Valdez and backup catcher Victor Caratini. They need to add some pitching because Valdez isn’t coming back. Other than that and a hopefully a few changes on the coaching staff, this team just needs to come back healthy. A healthy Astros team is a 95 win team. With all of the key players who were hurt for as much as they were, this team had no business competing for a playoff spot in the final games of the season. Congratulations to Seattle, they have a hell of a team this year. Enjoy it because Houston takes it back next year.",https://reddit.com/r/mlb/comments/1nsegy9/one_collapse_one_collapse_averted_one_potential/nglfayw/,2025-09-28T03:56:49+00:00,Mets,774
