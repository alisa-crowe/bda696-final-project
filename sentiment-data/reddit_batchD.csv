reddit_post,Astros,aotex,"a few words from an elder fan Alright kiddos, gather round. Pappy wants to talk to y‚Äôall for just a minute. Now I know we‚Äôre all going through a rough patch here, seeing as it isn‚Äôt even October yet and after today our boys will already be done playing baseball for the year. Most of you young‚Äôuns have never been through a Fall season where reliable old Altuve isn‚Äôt making a nuisance of himself for some other city‚Äôs baseball team. And I know you‚Äôre confused, even hurt, maybe even a little angry or indignant. It just don‚Äôt feel right, does it? The playoffs are when real baseball starts, and the Astros don‚Äôt get to play? How can that be? And I‚Äôve heard all your caterwauling and your tantrums about it - ‚ÄúFire Espada, he clearly can‚Äôt manage!‚Äù ‚ÄúFire the coaches, the team forgot how to hit!‚Äù ‚ÄúFire the med staff, they don‚Äôt know what in tarnation they‚Äôre doing!‚Äù ‚ÄúFramber‚Äôs a bad teammate!‚Äù ‚ÄúLance should just retire!‚Äù Yeah, yeah, yeah, Pappy‚Äôs heard it all, and frankly, I probably even agree with some of it. But before we get too riled up, I think a little healthy perspective might help just a mite bit. You see, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware our Astros have played in the playoffs every season since 2015, minus a little hiccup in 2016 when we were just getting this ball rolling. Heck, we didn‚Äôt even play .500 ball in 2020, and we still ended up one win away from playing in another World Series that year! Now your Ol‚Äô Pappy isn‚Äôt that great at math, but he went back and looked up some numbers. And if I‚Äôm figuring correctly, since 2015, our Astros have played over 100 games in the playoffs! Ain‚Äôt that something? And they‚Äôve got a win-loss record of 62-43, winning 16 series and losing seven. That‚Äôs some heavy lifting in October and November, y‚Äôall! But what I really want y‚Äôall to pay attention to is what those numbers looked like before 2015. Because I honestly think you little whippersnappers take this whole ‚Äúwinning in the playoffs‚Äù thing for granted. You probably know we‚Äôd never won the World Series before 2017, and that‚Äôs a real big deal. But you might not remember that before 2015, our Astros had only won a total of 21 postseason games over 53 years - and only won three postseason series, losing nine. Heck, we didn‚Äôt ever advance in the playoffs until 2004! That‚Äôs over half a century without very much baseball in October. And when it did happen, it included some real doozies. In 1980, we had the lead in a would-be pennant clincher against the Phillies in the Astrodome going into the 8th inning, only to bumble the game away‚Ä¶ and then did the same thing again the next night! In 1981, we had a 2-0 lead against the Dodgers and just needed one more win for our first playoff series win, but lost three straight games and couldn‚Äôt seal the deal. Game 6 of the 1986 NLCS against the Mets is still considered one of the wackiest and greatest sports games ever played in the USA, and we ended up on the wrong side of it. And thinking about those pesky Braves teams in the late 1990‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs still makes me shudder, even if we did finally get over the hump against them‚Ä¶ on the fourth attempt‚Ä¶ But even those years at least had some success. There were loooooong stretches in there where things were‚Ä¶ rough. Some of you older cousins can remember when the Astros were the laughingstock of both leagues, back when Altuve first came up and the team was losing 100 games a season on the regular. But we didn‚Äôt even make it into the playoffs until the team was almost 20 years old! Even considering our recent run of success, for every two seasons the Astros have made the postseason, there‚Äôs about five that they didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a lot of swings and misses. So sure, I get that you‚Äôre sad and angry and let down, and that‚Äôs fine. I feel much the same way and I reckon you‚Äôll hear me complain about it some, too. But I‚Äôve heard some of you little knotheads making some interesting comments, saying things like, ‚ÄúI'm just glad this trainwreck of a season is over,‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is the most embarrassing team I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been so ashamed to be a fan,‚Äù and honestly, kiddos, I just have to sigh and say, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall got no idea.‚Äù On the whole, recent years have been pretty good to us. This might be the most embarrassing season when you‚Äôve been paying attention, but for those of us who‚Äôve been around for a minute, it doesn‚Äôt even make the list of the Bottom Ten. And you did see how often our boys got hurt this year, didn‚Äôt you? Wasn‚Äôt it just a mite bit exciting to see those young Skeeters come up and do a few flashy things? The season‚Äôs 162 games long, and they managed a year where 160 of them counted for something. Fans in Denver and the south side of Chicago have known their fate since before hurricane season started‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs been plenty of years where it‚Äôs been that way here in Houston, too. I know we wish it turned out different, but a foul ball here, a called strike there, next thing you know you‚Äôve won or lost one or two more games and that decides whether you‚Äôre in or out for October. You can be mad, but if you can try, it might be nice to be just a little bit content as well. And one more thing before I let you go back to your games and your smartphones and whatnot‚Ä¶ Sure, it might hurt your feelings a bit when you see fans of all the other teams dancing on our grave, acting like Munchkins singing about the Wicked Witch getting flattened like a pancake. But you gotta step back and recognize: THIS IS WHO EVERY FAN WANTS THEIR TEAM TO BE! I think it was a famous ballplayer from the 80‚Äôs named Reggie Jackson who said, ‚ÄúFans don‚Äôt boo nobodies.‚Äù And sure, I know somebody in a Yankees hat or a Dodgers jersey is gonna sneer something about ‚Äúcheaters,‚Äù but a sustained run like what we‚Äôve had - most of which happened after the scandal - doesn‚Äôt happen without talent, dedication, and teamwork. The Houston Astros earned the right to be the team everybody else wants to lose. So let them dance around today, because we‚Äôve had most of the last decade to do plenty of our own two-stepping and salsaing and whatever else you kids do nowadays, now haven‚Äôt we? I know I‚Äôm rambling. Just know we‚Äôre gonna be alright, kiddos. You‚Äôre a good bunch, keep your heads up and stay out of too much trouble. Keep making your Pappy proud. I look forward to watching more baseball with you in the Spring.

reddit_post,Astros,Gemnist,"We‚Äôre probably going to blow it, BUT: If it happens, I think we will finally be allowed to take the time and appreciate just how good the past ten years have been. Let‚Äôs go over the numbers: * Eight consecutive postseason appearances, the fourth most all-time. We also outlasted the Braves, who will finish this season with a losing record after going seven consecutive appearances and being relegated to fifth, while the next highest active streak is the Phillies who only just got to four. Oh yeah, and we also made it in 2015, and have now appeared in the postseason more times than any other expansion team. * Seven consecutive championship series appearances, the second most all-time and the most in the American League. To get there, we also won a playoff series in seven consecutive postseasons, the most of any team ever. * One MVP * Three Cy Young awards, giving us five to tie us with the D-Backs and Padres for the second most of all expansion teams. * Two Rookies of the Year * Four 100-win seasons, giving us five total, more than any other expansion team. * Seven division titles, giving us thirteen for the most of any expansion team. This includes four in a row, a feat that hasn‚Äôt been accomplished in the AL West since the dynasty A‚Äôs of the 70s. * Two World Series (our first) and four pennants. In doing so, we went from one of the weakest teams in the World Series to being tied with the Mets for the most pennants of any expansion team, as well as among the several tied for most World Series wins. * We became the expansion team with the best cumulative regular season record of all time, as well as one of only two along with the Angels with 5000 total wins, and are the only expansion team with an all-time winning record. TL;DR: we have gone from one of the more middling teams in American sports, to now becoming inarguably **the most successful expansion team in baseball history**. Let that sink in. We just lived through the golden age of Houston sports, rivaled only by 90s basketball, and I‚Äôm completely grateful to have lived through that. Do I wish there was more? Oh absolutely, I especially wanted Altuve to get another chance at breaking Manny Ramirez‚Äôs postseason home run record. But the best part of being a fan of a sports city that doesn‚Äôt win all the time is that you learn how to appreciate the little things and become patient for when the big things come.

reddit_comment,Astros,DrFloppyTitties,"Something needs to be done about the injuries. I'm not sure if its luck, that the team is made of glass, or if these medical staff is awful. But something has to be done to get consistency in the lineup. Obviously not having your best player for most of the season was the big issue this year, maybe just behind the 10 elbows that were blown out this year by the pitching staff. Its hard to say the team really need pitching when it takes a literal generational injury bug to make the teams era not top 5. But oddly enough, outside of LMJs starts, I never really felt pitching ever put games too out of hand. There was no production from anyone outside of Pena. I dont think that happens again next year. I'm honestly more hopeful about next year than I was last season about this year.

This year met expectations unless we sneak in and surprise.

reddit_comment,Astros,Sad_Poem4202,"Well put. We have had a run that few MLB teams have known, in modern times, in is especially difficult to put together the kind of run that the Astros have. When you factor in the nature of the game today with free agency and huge team payrolls, it becomes more and more difficult to hang onto your core players and continue your success year by year. The Astros have a first class organization from top to bottom. I don‚Äôt think enough people give Jim Crane credit for all that he has done for this team and for how involved and caring he is. No doubt injuries contributed to the dropoff this year. I also have no doubt that the Astros will bounce back. It may not happen in 2026 as the face of the team is going to go through some changes. However, baseball is a business as well as entertainment, and I think our team has been very frugal and wise in the way they have put together contenders. Yes, we lost the likes of Bregman and Tucker. But through some smart dealing, we have picked up people like Paredes, Cam Smith, Hayden Wesneski and have brought back Carlos Correa. Correa‚Äôs leadership is going to be of more value to Houston at this point in his career than his bat and glove, but we can‚Äôt underestimate how nice it is to have him back. The three other players I mentioned, while maybe not bound as superstars, have all shown the ability to contribute to this team going forward. I‚Äôm a native Houstonian and have followed the Astros since their inception. Over the years, we‚Äôve had great players and we‚Äôve seen great players move on. But I agree that what we have built here is more than a single team or a single season. It‚Äôs safe to say that we have built a legacy of baseball in Houston.",https://reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/1nqsflh/were_probably_going_to_blow_it_but/ngczo51/,2025-09-26T19:34:30+00:00,Mets,1702

reddit_comment,Astros,Doyce_7,"I think it depends on what you mean by ""over."" I think the days of being World Series contenders(outside of a more fluky run) is probably done and they are transitioning to a playoff contender instead. There's nothing wrong with this, many fambases would kill to just have a shot every year. But I do think the ""Astros are inevitable"" era is over. I hope to be wrong. The thing is, because the farm system is so bad, they are going to have to spend money on FAs to keep it rolling and Crane will only do short term deals, which means older players, like Abreu and Walker. Crane said the window will always be open while he owns the team, well, unless they magically get a much much better farm, or drastically depart from contract policy, I don't see more than a few more years of competing. My biggest fear is that they keep chasing it until the team craters and get stuck in another 11-13 type of rebuild with bad contracts, an old roster and still no farm. Look at the Phillies in early 2010s, they kept trying and trying long after it was over and it cost them a decade of being bad.",https://reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/1nur61h/why_do_i_see_so_many_outside_this_sub_saying_the/nh3bfca/,2025-09-30T22:53:31+00:00,Astros,1087

With that, they completely revamp anything to do with hitting in the entire organization and work on implementing a more patient approach at the plate.

reddit_post,Astros,SleepJust,"2008 Astros/2025 Astros Starting to see similarities in the post 2005 Astros WS team and what they are dealing with now; An aging core group and no top tier prospects coming up through the system. That 2008 team finished 86-75 with Berkman (**6.9 WAR!**)(age 32), Lee (2.8)(32), Tejada (1.9)(34), Oswalt (.3)(30), Wiggington (2.2)(30) and many others in their 30s. The only younger meaningful players were Pence(2.3)(25) and Bourn(**-.6**)(25). The current team does have a few more guys in their 20s (Diaz (2.7)(26), Pena(**5.6**)(27) Paredes (2.3)(26), Smith (1.9)(22), Alvarez (.7)(28), and Brown (**6.1 WAR**)(26), Spaghetti(25), Wesneski (27), Javier(28) and others. Obviously there is more youth here, and you can justifiably blame injuries as well. But some of these guys are just injury prone and it probably isn't realistic to count on full seasons from a few. **I wonder what Luhnow would do with this current team?** It probably would be constructed differently if he were still in charge when they signed Abreu, Montero, Walker, etc. My guess is that you hope for a much healthier 2026 team, find a couple of starting pitchers, fix the infield situation and make one or two more runs at the WS. But the fork in the road is coming soon if not already here. Pena and Brown won't come cheap. It would have been interesting to see how Luhnow would have tried to balance and sustain success.",https://reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/1ntl41h/2008_astros2025_astros/,2025-09-29T15:29:48+00:00,Astros,1398
reddit_comment,Astros,Anxious_South_5150,"I get your point, but throwing Walker into the same level of contract as Abreu + Montero after 1 season is WILD to me. He still produced 1.1 fWAR and it‚Äôs not as if he was a black hole in every aspect of the game like JA or a clear MASSIVE overpay after 1 good season at a historically cheap position like RP. Edit: To your main point if JL were to be GM I think the squad would be MUCH further into a deep rebuild. We wouldn‚Äôt have ever signed Graveman, Montero, Hader or really any other big RPs most likely. Maldy probabaly would‚Äôve been gone quicker w/ Diaz playing more. I think JL would‚Äôve put more value on a guy who could field AND hit (even with injury concerns) and pushed more for Correa. Some of the OF depth would‚Äôve been shipped for MiLB pieces and some of the pitching maybe shuffled around after 2023. Tucker still gets traded.

reddit_comment,Astros,electrikmayham,"The Astros, and teams that have been postseason regulars for the better part of a decade, don't rely much on staying relevant by nurturing the prospects. If you haven't been paying attention, we get a lot of our players from outside the draft. We sign a lot from Latin America. We make trades that allow us to get prospects from other team, player who are likely to be impactful on the 40 man roster very quickly. We sign players and we develop them. Its very hard to win and have a robust farm system, so smartly, we don't lean into that. The Astros have found a way to be a postseason team year in and year out, without having to give up and rebuild for 3 years. The system works. The Astros are the 12th youngest team in baseball and only 2 younger teams made the playoffs this year. In 2016 they were the 14th youngest (but younger on avg than today).

reddit_post,Astros,davi017,"My Astros Off Season and 2026 Preview This has the potential the be the busiest off season in a long time. There is a log jam of players who are good enough to be major leaguers but not good enough to be every day guys here. I would love to see us get some controllable arms, starters and relievers. These are the guys I would look at trading. Players to be traded: - Brice Matthews - Zach Cole - George Costanza - Chas McCormick - Jesus Sanchez - Zach Dezenzo - Pedro Leon Zach Cole might be the most controversial of the group. He‚Äôs been great over the last few weeks and has been really fun to watch, but I don‚Äôt see him doing it over 162. Trade him while his value is up. I also don‚Äôt see Brice Matthews being anything more than a below average to average major leaguer. Players they‚Äôre going to have to make work due to contracts: - Christian Walker - Lance McCullers - Jose Altuve Position players in 2026 are going to change game to game. I don‚Äôt see Paredes having an every day position, but I see him playing every day. 1B, 2B, DH, and giving Correa some days off at 3B should provide enough places to plug him. Altuve continues moving between 2B, LF, and DH. Catcher: - Continue with Yainer as every day catcher - Sign veteran on 1 year deal - Walker Janek starts in AA, would love to see him force his way up to the big club at some point. At minimum he ends season at AAA First Base: - Not going to be able to move Christian Walker‚Äôs contract. He‚Äôs the every day guy - Isaac Paredes gets some work there as well Second Base: - Rotation of Altuve, Paredes, Urias, and Dubon Shortstop: - Pena. Do not extend him this off season. He needs to stay healthy and show he can repeat his 2025 production Third Base: - Correa. I think he can have a career resurgence at a less demanding position Outfield: - Cam, Jake, Altuve, Yordan, Dubon, Urias Starting Rotation: - Biggest area of need - Brown, Javier, Spighetti locked in - Sign 1 or 2 veterans and/or trade for a controllable guy - Extend Hunter Brown Bullpen: - Hader, Abreu locked in - McCullers moves to pen as a 1 inning guy Manager: - Joe has gotta go. I think next year‚Äôs club will need a veteran manager due to moving pieces they‚Äôll have to deal with every day. Dana: - He stays. This is too important of an off season to start over, again.

reddit_comment,Astros,SodaCanBob,">Manager: - Joe has gotta go. I think next year‚Äôs club will need a veteran manager due to moving pieces they‚Äôll have to deal with every day. I don't agree with this at all. With the amount of injuries this team has had he had to deal with moving pieces on a near daily basis this year anyway and I think its incredibly impressive that the dude managed to keep the team in the running as long as he did, *especially* with it only being his second year.",https://reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/1nsvipu/my_astros_off_season_and_2026_preview/ngoxtzr/,2025-09-28T18:25:26+00:00,Astros,451
reddit_comment,Astros,7567Jeff,"""Players to be traded"" We should NOT trade Matthews, Cole, Sanchez, and Dezenzo. Those players are under team control and are likely our future. ""Players they‚Äôre going to have to make work due to contracts"" Walker or Mcullers is likely gonna be traded. Walker is more likely cuz of the lack of depth at sp we need mcullers and our infield is stacked like crazy with paredes coming back. ""Manager"" This by far is the most stupidest take I have seen. Excuse for me hostilty but the people wanting Espada fired are absolutley delusional and arent seeing the bigger picture. We at one point were #1 in the AL with half the roster on the IL. The amount of adjustments he had to make with hitting and pitching was a managerial nightmare even the most seasoned managers would not be able to handle. We should not be firing him for factors not in his control. The people we should fire are the medical staff and strength and conditioning and maybe out hitting coaches.",https://reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/1nsvipu/my_astros_off_season_and_2026_preview/ngp1hwk/,2025-09-28T18:42:58+00:00,Astros,960

reddit_comment,Astros,Bootleschloogen,Espada did a great job IMO. Many baseball analysts have been writing that his moves were overall positive in the regular season especially considering the dogshit hand he was dealt due to injury and roster construction. My only gripe with Espada is that he simply has the look of someone not fired up even though im sure inside he is. For me the only coaching changes to do would be fire the hitting coaches. The Astros have been focusing too much on putting the ball in play and not hitting for power these last few seasons. Sure they get on base but the run conversion has been among the worst in the league and our extra base hits are also middling despite the players we have.,https://reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/1nsvipu/my_astros_off_season_and_2026_preview/ngub6f8/,2025-09-29T15:22:47+00:00,Astros,680

reddit_comment,Astros,Prayray,"> Players to be traded: - Brice Matthews: He‚Äôs 23, they aren‚Äôt trading him, although he‚Äôll likely spend next year in AAA - Zach Cole: He‚Äôs likely starting in the OF next season, they aren‚Äôt dealing him. - George Costanza: Maybe, but I doubt it as you likely won‚Äôt get much for him. Teams want to see another year where he‚Äôs decent after the Astros picked him off the scrap heap. Astros also need depth in the rotation - Chas McCormick: He‚Äôll be non-tendered. No one is trading for him. - Jesus Sanchez: Almost definitely. I don‚Äôt see where he fits and they have better options. - Zach Dezenzo: I doubt he has much value at the moment. Hopefully he heals up this offseason and can provide some good depth for this team. - Pedro Leon: Probably at AAA for one more year. He has zero value. > Players they‚Äôre going to have to make work due to contracts: - Christian Walker: He has value and they‚Äôll likely trade him, although they may have to eat some money. Need to deal him for a MLB pitcher. - Lance McCullers: They‚Äôll give him a shot in the spring, but if he can‚Äôt improve, they might just DFA him since he‚Äôs in the last year of his contract. I wish he‚Äôd focus on moving to the bullpen, but he seems hesitant to that. - Jose Altuve: Altuve is fine. He‚Äôs declining, but still solid. He doesn‚Äôt need to be batting 4th though. > Catcher: - ‚ÄúContinue with Yainer as every day catcher‚Äù. likely outcome and, with ABS coming on, isn‚Äôt a bad choice - ‚ÄúSign veteran on 1 year deal‚Äù. they might re-sign Caratini as the backup if he‚Äôs willing‚Ä¶otherwise, Salazar will be the backup - ‚ÄúWalker Janek starts in AA, would love to see him force his way up to the big club at some point. At minimum he ends season at AAA‚Äù. probably correct, but he may stay in AA as catchers tend to not get moved around a lot. > First Base: - ‚ÄúNot going to be able to move Christian Walker‚Äôs contract. He‚Äôs the every day guy‚Äù. His contract is moveable. His road stats were solid, he‚Äôs solid defensively, and teams may chalk up his struggles to not adjusting to Daikin. - ‚ÄúIsaac Paredes gets some work there as well‚Äù. Likely the starting every day 1B. If you re-sign Caratini, he can be the backup. > Second Base: - ‚ÄúRotation of Altuve, Paredes, Urias, and Dubon‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think Paredes will be able to play 2B. My guess is the other three will fill the position, with Matthews being the depth piece there in case of injury. > Shortstop: - ‚ÄúPena Do not extend him this off season. He needs to stay healthy and show he can repeat his 2025 production‚Äù. Any chances of extending him are likely gone unless you offer him a contract Crane‚Äôs never given. > Third Base: - ‚ÄúCorrea‚Äù. I think he can have a career resurgence at a less demanding position: Agreed > Outfield: - ‚Å†‚ÄùCam, Jake, Altuve, Yordan, Dubon, Urias‚Äù. Urias has never played OF and the Altuve experiment failed. My guess is we‚Äôll see Jake, Cam, and Cole as the starters with Dezenzo and Dubon filling in and Yordan playing out there sparingly. > Starting rotation: - ‚ÄúBiggest area of need‚Äù Definitely. You need at least two MLB arms this offseason - ‚ÄúBrown, Javier, Spighetti locked in‚Äù. Broen and Javier should be ok‚Ä¶jury is still out on Arrighetti - ‚ÄúSign 1 or 2 veterans and/or trade for a controllable guy‚Äù. Yep, need at least two MLB arms - ‚ÄúExtend Hunter Brown‚Äù. doubt this happens. He‚Äôll want huge money that Crane doesn‚Äôt give and Boras will likely want him going to free agency > Bullpen: - ‚ÄúHader, Abreu locked in‚Äù. Hopefully Hader is healthy. We also need depth for the bullpen‚Ä¶either solid depth guys or close to ready arms. - ‚ÄúMcCullers moves to pen as a 1 inning guy‚Äù. I‚Äôd hope he takes this role, but he‚Äôs seemed resistant to it. > Manager: - ‚ÄúJoe has gotta go. I think next year‚Äôs club will need a veteran manager due to moving pieces they‚Äôll have to deal with every day‚Äù: Nope. Espada almost had this team in the playoffs with the most WAR lost due to injuries. He‚Äôs a solid manager, but he needs to replace his hitting coaches. - Dana: ‚Å†‚Äù He stays. This is too important of an off season to start over, again. He has brought in some good pieces. Let him keep going: I‚Äôve thought Brown has been solid.‚Äù Really needs to audit the hitting coaches and medical staff as well as the front office, but he‚Äôs seemed resistant made some great moves this season. Absolutely no reason to lose him.",https://reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/1nsvipu/my_astros_off_season_and_2026_preview/ngq4046/,2025-09-28T21:49:59+00:00,Astros,4326

Knowing Altuve has been playing hurt for some time now, seeing Paredes fight his way to come back when he really shouldn't have. How many of these guys that weren't on the IL could have been playing in more pain than we realized. I wanted this team to persevere through what feels like unprecedented injuries and make it, but it wasn't meant to be. Maybe an October off could do this team some good.

I'm so happy to have been from Houston to get to watch great men such as Gerrit Cole, Jeremy Pena, Zack Greinke, Justin Verlander, Jose Altuve, Yordan Alvarez, Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman, Yuli Gurriel, Carlos Correa, George Springer, Dallas Keuchel, Josh Reddick, and despite his honestly nightmarishly terrible, and despicable regular season, we even got to see a historically great postseason by Jose Abreu in 2023. I can only hope and pray we can continue to watch such great baseball for as long as possible, and hopefully we can learn something from this injury riddled season and come back with a vengeance next year and re-establish our Golden Era dynasty!!

Hear me out This could be a playoff bound team if our best pieces stay healthy and the organization seriously addresses the medial and coaching staff. The AAA players that were up to the task this season still give me something to look forward to in 2026. 2025 doesn't feel like a fair assessment of the team because of the compounded effects of injuries, dead money on the books, bad medicals and shit coaching. I think we could all be more confident in saying the Astros' run is over if 2026 ends like this season did with a team that is consistently healthy. Let's be real, the AL West is still weak and it took a huge collapse for the Mariners to overtake the Astros. Rangers thought they were hot shit after 23 and look where they are now. There's no assurance a team's success one season will carry over to the next. The Mariners can enjoy their accomplishment, the real question is if they can sustain it like the Astros did.

reddit_comment,Astros,NicolasBroaddus,"Great new pitching options despite the injuries, we got Jason Alexander, Blubaugh, Gordon, plus several solid new relievers grinded out of our minor league machine. Then we have team control of a bunch of infield squad we can mix around while also shopping pieces as part of trades to make our lineup more stable. Plus two new rookie outstanding outfielders in Cam Smith and Zach Cole, which puts possible answers in our other big question spots given repeated Yordan and Jake injuries. If fangraphs' article is even slightly accurate, we had basically a 100 win team this year if not for the insane number of and insanely impactful injuries we suffered. I can't really blame these on the team's medical staff this time like everyone likes to with the Tucker injury drama. Our rehab seems to have been really good given how Yordan, Jake, and Paredes have all come back, as well as the pitchers before their elbows exploded again. There's clearly deeper issues with the league and pitcher injuries going on in the modern high spin + pitch clock era. I see so much hate for Espada day by day here and its so disheartening. What Espada has done with deeply injured teams or with players who should never have been signed has been better than could have ever been expected. He strung together insane wins with a AAA lineup through half the season, but, just like with 2024, you can't keep a rotation and bullpen going on coaching and fumes a _whole_ season. The window has far from closed, next season will be fun.

We lost more in WAR than any other team has. It doesn't fully excuse the season-long narrative of complete impotence with RISP, nor would the players use that as an excuse. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered in the off-season. There are a lot of players that need time to heal. There are some batting philosophies that need to be abandoned. I'm not sad that the run of postseason success has taken a break. I'm happy that we experienced it. Let the others celebrate.

reddit_comment,Astros,dirtysock47,"Honestly, I don't think there's much that could've been done this season. Yeah, we can bitch about the offensive approach or Framber being a pumpkin for two months, but the biggest reason why this season has been the way it's been is injuries. We've had too many of them, and at the worst times possible. Yordan out again, Pe√±a out again, Meyers out again. 18 WAR on the IL this year. That would cripple any team. Just look forward to next year. Good news is we're basically only losing Framber and Caratini. We have the pieces. Just need new hitting & gameplanning coaches.

Today on the season finale episode of Apollo Hou on YouTube - they are predicting some top down changes that are likely to happen this week. Here is a link to the episode: https://www.youtube.com/live/uHcEoj8cF_E?si=pGqJQJgz6qQZ5V1l Those guys definitely have some good contacts within the clubhouse and the media that will speak to them off record. They had indications about CC1 at the trade deadline in the week before it happened. They never revealed sources and they never give specifics prior to it happening however they can come with the receipt receipts after the fact and show. To further this, I just sent Bonda on X a small excerpt of what they mentioned on the podcast and he agreed as well. Ben is also very well connected internally and gets a lot of the same information. Apollo does in knew about Carlos well before the trade deadline. Also, in fact, he was the one that broke it on X in the week leading up to it. A lot of terminations are already coming down in baseball today. Will be interesting to see what these changes are.

reddit_post,Astros,Palad1n2000,"What to do at Catcher (Or the absurdity of Yainer and Caratini's splits) Yainer Diaz had a mediocre to bad 2025 season. Alot of people want Caratini to be resigned and look to him as the primary catcher for next season. Yainer's stats though show the opposite: He needs to be an everyday catcher. As C: .269 BA, .749 OPS for a tOPS+ of 114 As DH: .202 BA, .488 OPS for a tOPS+ of 45 (!!!) Now, to be fair to the argument, Caratini was still a far superior offensive C, with a .322 BA, .884 OPS and a tOPS+ of 143, though he ended with 246 fewer PA than Yainer at C and was also significantly worse at DH with a drop of roughly .300 OPS Overall, the question at C is basically which player do you want to provide everyday reps for more: a 27 year old catcher who might have a higher ceiling or an older catcher who has more experience and more consistency",https://reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/1nsgyup/what_to_do_at_catcher_or_the_absurdity_of_yainer/,2025-09-28T06:13:05+00:00,A's,854

reddit_post,TexasRangers,mechanicBuckThirty,"Rangers aren‚Äôt as far off as many think Bochy struggled getting the young guys on board. CY stuck with a couple guys who had career 2023‚Äôs but regressed back to who they were. With the right manager, this team can be competitive with 3 moves this offseason. 1) Heim is gone. Need to replace him because Higgy can‚Äôt stay healthy. Higgy + Mid-tier catcher should shore up the position. 2) Seager is your DH. Joc‚Äôs money should be eaten. Walcott is your starting SS. 3) Adolis should be thanked, hell, I‚Äôd give him a statue if it were up to me. What he did vs Houston in the ALCS earned him one. But, his time with the team is done.

reddit_comment,TexasRangers,ehholfman,"Do you people keep up with Walcott at all? Genuine question because this is a constant talking point on this subreddit and it gets really tiring to read. Seager was one of the best defensive shortstops this season with 15 defensive runs saved (3rd most among all shortstops). I have zero clue why everyone wants him to be a full time DH when you see just how valuable he is specifically regarding just his defense. Seager has also said that playing defense is not contributing to him being hurt. He seemed to have his hamstring issues figured out and was relatively healthy until the appendectomy. Walcott, while incredibly athletic, doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs going to be an elite defender. The Rangers gave him about 20 games at 3B this season, and it will be interesting to see where he plays in the fall league coming up. Additionally, Walcott is nowhere near ready offensively. He had a fine season in AA (111 wRC+) but by no means was he tearing it up. He held his own which is impressive given his age, but he is not going to be in the show on opening day. The last thing I‚Äôd want for them to do is start his service time while he‚Äôs still in need of some minor league development.",https://reddit.com/r/TexasRangers/comments/1nutqch/rangers_arent_as_far_off_as_many_think/nh3s9v7/,2025-10-01T00:31:58+00:00,Rangers,1183

reddit_comment,TexasRangers,TeddyFive-06,"Heim is probably gone. They‚Äôll move to trade for or sign someone younger and cheaper that they believe in, like 2021 Jonah Heim, but if they strike out there‚Äôs a small chance he comes back with a 20% pay cut based on arbitration. Either way Higgy should be 1A. Seager is not your DH. He was near the top in DRS at short stop. His health is what it is, but if he‚Äôs healthy he‚Äôs at SS for another 2-3 years. Sebastian Walcott is 19 and was ‚Äúgood‚Äù at Frisco, not fantastic. He‚Äôll stay in Frisco for awhile to start 2026. Adolis is gone, his arbitration number is too high. Our 2026 right fielder is probably not on the roster. Helman could be a solid 4th outfielder at the moment, but him and Osuna could both use more playing time in AAA instead of a bench spot to start the year. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúgood offer‚Äù for Carter.

reddit_comment,TexasRangers,jfrodriguez1983,">Seager is your DH. Joc‚Äôs money should be eaten. Walcott is your starting SS. They are not moving Seager off SS. He was above average defensively this season and the hammy injuries he's had were baserunning not playing the field. Why are they going to move an above average defender off SS? Especially to DH. That would be a waste of his abilities. Talks of moving off of SS won't begin until he starts declining defensively. And while Walcott got hot the last month at AA, he struggled a bit for months before that. He could come to training camp and light it up, but as of now I don't think you can pencil him on the roster on opening day. When he's ready, he has a strong arm that also plays at 3B or RF. Also, you ride out Carter and bet on his talent because that is more valuable to us than what you might get on a trade.",https://reddit.com/r/TexasRangers/comments/1nutqch/rangers_arent_as_far_off_as_many_think/nh3rt6y/,2025-10-01T00:29:13+00:00,Rangers,827

They have big questions at almost every position. C, DH, 1B, 2B, 3B, CF, RF. Their SS is great but often injured. Eovaldi is 35 with a bum shoulder and a lengthy injury history. deGrom is 37 and it was nothing short of a miracle that he stayed healthy this season. If those two can manage to stay off the IL, their rotation will probably be four or five deep with Leiter, Bradford and Rocker. But the top two guys just can't be counted on, sadly. Walcott isn't ready so there's very little on the farm besides the Little Rascals, and while it's hard not to like them, they're not exactly top-tier prospects.

reddit_post,TexasRangers,TheBigSexy7,"One thing I definitely won't miss from 2025 Rangers radio broadcasts And no, it totally has nothing to do with our wonderful broadcasters, Eric, Matt, and Jared. They are the absolute best broadcast booth in MLB, and I do occasionally listen to others. Considering I live over 700 miles away, I rely on the MLB At Bat app to listen, and this year I probably caught about 75% of the games. Given that fact, I don't know if y'all hear the same commercials locally that I receive. So here is the thing I won't miss: The constant repetition of the Mountain Dew commercial. The jingle in and of itself is catchy, but also incredibly annoying. Most importantly, the voice over guy is absolutely insufferable and cringeworthy. So that's my piddling little complaint. Issues regarding player performance or lack thereof should be posted elsewhere in this sub.",https://reddit.com/r/TexasRangers/comments/1ntyvkb/one_thing_i_definitely_wont_miss_from_2025/,2025-09-30T00:29:15+00:00,Rangers,851

I‚Äôd say a top 5-10 pitching staff? I can‚Äôt have as much hope for the offense though, especially with pay roll going down and us saying goodbye to a lot of guys (probably a good thing tho). Seager will probably continue to struggle to stay healthy and I think we‚Äôve probably seen the best of Semien. If the core young guys of Jung Carter and Langford can‚Äôt be consistently above average we will be a bottom of the league offense again. Surely Pederson and Burger won‚Äôt suck 2 years in a row right? Right?? Idk man but this season stung. The league best pitching with (from another comment I read) the least amount of errors in baseball history? And we finished .500? + the late season hope and magic to be dashed by a sweep from our rivals and then the marlins? There was a lot of good stuff in there though.

reddit_post,TexasRangers,Brandinospappos,"Optimistic view for ‚Äò26 Don‚Äôt hate me, but I‚Äôm not of the doom & gloom outlook for next season. The core looks good to me even if they are injury prone. Injuries did not do us in this season. It was production from the middle tier players on the team. Joc Doli Heim Semein Jung were all basically free outs when it mattered. Jung was the only one who shouldn‚Äôt be outright ashamed of his numbers. deGrom, Evo, Leiter make a nice top 3 of the rotation. Latz Bradford & Rocker make a solid back end of the rotation. The Bullpen is a question mark but there‚Äôs some pieces with potential. Curvelo had TWO terrible outings but was otherwise good. Winn was fantastic. Garcia should‚Äôve never been the closer but was solid even with that bad stretch. There‚Äôs always a potential for someone in the farm to show up in the bigs and contribute in the 5th/6th innings. The lineup still has Seager Langford Smith Burger Jung Carter and Higgy. They all can improve on their ‚Äò25 production but they were not complete atrocities like Semien Joc Adolis and Heim. Removing 2-3 of the atrocities should create an improvement just by subtracting the bad and adding in a replacement level player. As it stands now, the payroll for ‚Äò26 is at 145M or so. They still have money to spend, especially if they let Doli and Heim go. If the Rangers can add a legitimate closer, a righty bat that can be serviceable against fastballs, and maybe a couple decent bullpen arms, there should be some potential to build off a good yet injury prone core. If only they can somehow convince Joc to retire.",https://reddit.com/r/TexasRangers/comments/1nsd0ct/optimistic_view_for_26/,2025-09-28T02:28:59+00:00,Rangers,1566
reddit_comment,TexasRangers,Triple_Crown14,"It probably won‚Äôt happen, but I‚Äôd love if Sebastian Walcott was able to make the big league club after spring training. His energy is the kind we need, and I think he‚Äôd fit in really well with our other younger guys. I really liked what I saw from Osuna, Freeman, and Helman. I think Doli and Heim should 100% be gone next year, they were just a very dark spot in the lineup. Joc too but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be able to get rid of him, just have to hope this was an aberration year from him. At the start of the year I wanted us to sign Jung to a team friendly longer term deal but now I‚Äôm really not sold on him. His glove is good but the bat is not quite what you‚Äôd want. I really feel like Semien needs break his slow start trend and hit well out the gate next year. Maybe give him the occasional off day because I think the amount of games he‚Äôs played is affecting his hitting now that he‚Äôs older. I like our rotation outlook like you said, if Rocker could take some big steps and improve similar to how Jack did that‚Äôll be such a boon for us, I‚Äôm rooting for him to.",https://reddit.com/r/TexasRangers/comments/1nsd0ct/optimistic_view_for_26/ngl59gk/,2025-09-28T02:46:33+00:00,Rangers,1070
reddit_comment,TexasRangers,Tuffwith2Fs,I know everyone is hating on Doli and Heim and Jung but I'm not ready to give up on them.

reddit_comment,TexasRangers,Horse_Hog5050,"I'm not sure how Jung shouldn't be ashamed. .682 OPS. I'd like to be proven wrong, but I think he's cooked. He'll be 28 in February, so it's not like he's a kid. Is his regression due to the injuries, or did the injuries just prolong the amount of time it took for it to be obvious that the league has a book on him. My only real optimism is Evo, deGrom, and Jack. I think Jack will take another big step forward net year and look like a front-line starter. Hopefully Rocker will do next year what Jack did this year. I feel like we should probably try to re-sign Mahle. When healthy he was great for us, but his market might be limited because of his injuries. He might take a 1-2 year deal and if so, we should sign him. We need to figure out how to get at least 2 good bats.

reddit_comment,TexasRangers,Terr1fyer,"The pitching is something to be very excited about, especially if we can add a decent bullpen arm or two, but certain players have to return to form (Seager, Heim, Jung). Langford has to become the player he was drafted to be. The front office has to decide on the futures of Semien, Garcia, and Carter. Unfortunately, I feel we're stuck with Semien as he's entering his age 35 season with that massive contract and has underperformed the past two seasons. He either finds his mojo again and helps this team with another run or by playing himself into a good trade piece. If not, we're stuck with him through 2028. With Garcias age and nagging injury history who knows if he'll ever be El Bombi again, and the front office needs to decide if he's worth keeping around. His contract ended this season and the team has total control until 2027, so it will be interesting to see how they handle the situation. As for Evan Carter, how serious is the back? Does he have a legitimate future? His situation is easiest cause he's still under a team friendly deal and he's pre-arb, so the org will likely continue to just take it slow with him. Then there's the Bochy situation on top of everything. Who's even managing next year? I had decently high hopes for this year. I wasn't necessarily expecting to be back in the WS, but the playoffs should have been easily reachable and it worries me that part of it may have been Bochy losing the clubhouse. We all know how younger players respond to 70 year olds nowadays. Here's to next year. Edit: i forgot the absolute albatross that is Joc because we are 100% stuck with him. He needs to get his ass on a strength and conditioning program in the offseason and not show up to camp looking like a busted can of biscuits. Maybe then he won't be a complete black hole in the lineup.",https://reddit.com/r/TexasRangers/comments/1nsd0ct/optimistic_view_for_26/ngll64m/,2025-09-28T04:42:41+00:00,Rangers,1818
reddit_comment,TexasRangers,EfficientDot18,"I don't think Jung is the given starting 3B for 2026. I still wouldn't be surprised if he gets traded as a reclamation project on another team. He had a .528 OPS in September and then the situation where Chris Young openly called him out. A right handed platoon bat that I would like to aim for is Rob Refsnyder, but then again, he's been pretty below average everywhere outside of the Red Sox, so it feels he either will go back or be a bad signing. Closers to target would be Raisel Iglesias and Robert Suarez.",https://reddit.com/r/TexasRangers/comments/1nsd0ct/optimistic_view_for_26/nglmm19/,2025-09-28T04:54:32+00:00,Rangers,512

reddit_comment,TexasRangers,Rangerlifr,"I drove 9 hours to Cleveland for this series, and won't watch an inning of the Wild Card Series no matter who's in it, so why would I want any outcome other than the one I got? Awesome game, I do hope the Guardians find their way to the playoffs, as their fans couldn't have been cooler to us, even in defeat on the way out of the park. As for the game itself, I was at Leiter's ML debut in Detroit last year, can't believe how far he's come. Really a season to build on. Also great to see Osuna drove a ball like that in a big situation. And it was pretty fun to see the actors who play Flo & Jamie in the Progressive ads come out in character to throw comically bad first pitches. My sister thought Al Leiter was sitting a couple rows in front of us behind first base. I never got a good look at the guy, so I'm not sure.",https://reddit.com/r/TexasRangers/comments/1nrj7pr/post_game_chat_926_rangers_7_guardians_3/ngf5a8r/,2025-09-27T03:09:07+00:00,Rangers,823

reddit_post,TexasRangers,SandmanTX131,"With Boch confirmed to be leaving, my #1 offseason priority is Mike Maddux. And no, I didn't mis-type that title. I would prioritize Maddux even before any player acquisitions. Any manager I hired would be contingent on keeping Maddux as Pitching Coach. I don't think it's a coincidence that Mike has been the pitching coach for *literally half* of the top 10 best pitched seasons in franchise history. At this point, the dude should be considered a team legend, and I think he is criminally underrated. We never should have let him leave in the first place back in 2015, and we surely shouldn't let him leave now.

reddit_post,Mariners,ge2ibck5_whoa,"MLB Network's opinion on MVP race I like MLB Network on as background noise. Having lots of Mariners story lines this year has meant I've paid a bit closer attention than normal. Obviously knowing their studios are in New Jersey it's expected to have a heavy dose of East Coast (Yankees) favoritism. This morning Steve Phillips (former Mets GM) was chatting with a guest on the topic of Judge vs. Cal for MVP. The guest was almost laughing to himself about how comical the topic was as Judge was so obviously the correct choice, only after all that admitting he's not very familiar with Cal's game. 1. HOW DARE YOU NOT FULLY IMMERSE YOURSELF IN ALL THAT THE DUMPER HAS LOVINGLY PROVIDED TO YOU 2. Since Seattle is a billion miles from everywhere I'm used to East Coast based media getting their beauty sleep while we soak in the oft misery of what this team delivers. But that means they are also missing out on all the Good Vibes‚Ñ¢/wins this team has been shelling out. If Cal sets the HR record I think it's all moot, btw. If he doesn't, what do you think Cal's chances are? Phillips couldn't get over the .170 difference in OPS in Judge's favor.

reddit_comment,Mariners,Glad-Equipment-8118,The .170 OPS difference is a valid argument. Cal catching is a very valid argument. An OPS of 1.1XX has only been attained by four active players. OPS+ of over 200 by two active players. Cal getting 60 and being a reigning platinum glover at Catcher I think makes Cal the MVP. Cal's role in getting the M's to the division title also solidifies that. Cal getting to 62 absolutely needs to guarantee him MVP. Judge is putting up inner-circle hall of fame numbers.

reddit_comment,Mariners,BlueMan-HD,"My only gripe with the argument of Judge > Cal is the misleading way in which it‚Äôs presented. Guys like to rattle off a stats like its a grocery store list when it reality it‚Äôs all the same number, hits and walks. When you boil down the stats, judge leads in hits and walks. BA, OBP, SLG, OPS, WRC+, all that is basically just the same two(ish) numbers presented different ways. So judge has more hits and more walks, that‚Äôs two numbers he leads in, and he has a narrow lead in fWAR. But when someone says he leads in hits, walks, batting average, on base, slugging, ops is just a little silly to me. I also don‚Äôt like the idea that Cal winning is somehow laughable (i mainly see this from Yankee fans and some pundits, but still) over Judge, as if a player hitting for 60+ HRs, 125 RBIs, 2nd bWAR, 2nd fWAR, 2nd Hits, 2nd in Walks is a stain on the sacred MVP is just bonkers. Mind you, i think Judge is going to win MVP because of media bias and his shopping list of stats and i wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be irate because he is deserving, but MVP has always been a unique award over SS and GG because it seems to be more of a ‚Äústory‚Äù award then the others. Voters do tend to factor things beyond pure stats, so Cal definitely has a better story this year than judge by a mile. There have only two (technically one) instances that a player hitting 60+ HRs did NOT win an MVP. 1927 - Babe Ruth, he had already won an MVP previously so was not allowed to receive another one, therefore he was not included on the ballot and is widely considered to have won the award had he been allowed. Second was 1999 Chipper Jones over Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa for being a great power switch hitter (wonder where we‚Äôve seen that before??).

The award is the MOST VALUABLE PLAYER. There are two sides to playing -- offense and defense. What Cal does almost every night behind the plate is so much more than anything Judge does in the field, it's laughable. So how does one weight that against offense?

reddit_comment,Mariners,TheEmperorsNewHose,"FWIW the betting markets flipped - Judge had been the favorite all year, but it moved to Cal after he hit number 60. Not necessarily predictive, but worth noting. Ultimately each sportswriter has to decide for themselves whether (60) + (catcher) matters more than the 150 point advantage Judge has in OPS. In a vacuum I think the edge would go to Judge - the older beat writers who love big benchmark numbers have largely retired and given way to younger guys who are more inclined to look at the analytics - but he‚Äôs won 2 out of the last 3 years and it‚Äôs possible Judge fatigue might be enough to push the needle towards Cal.

reddit_post,Mariners,Professional_Ad_4947,"I watched all 162 games this season and here‚Äôs what it felt like Longtime lurker, first time posting. This is my reflection on this season and what it meant to me, a lifelong Mariners fan on the East Coast. Enjoy. 162 games. I watched them all. From Opening Day in March to the last out tonight, baseball has been the rhythm of my life for seven months. It‚Äôs hard to explain to anyone who hasn‚Äôt lived it: the way this game becomes the clock you measure your year against. The way a random Thursday in June at 10:10 can matter just as much as October. This season gave me everything. The early hope. Nostalgia. The fear of collapse. The soaring nights and the pit-in-your-stomach losses. Victor Robles throwing his body into the net in San Francisco, breaking himself for a catch, then coming back to make the Superman grab in Houston that all but clinched October. Cal rewriting Mariners history. Baseball history. Home Run Derby champ. Passing Griffey for the most home runs as a Mariner. Finishing with 60 home runs. JP‚Äôs web gems. The Cole Young walk-off in his debut. Julio being Julio. Geno‚Äôs return. Josh Fucking Naylor. Rowdy Tellez on Easter in Toronto. The Little League Classic. Logan Evans sweating through his turtleneck in New York. The Fourth of July game. The bigger font returning to the nameplates. The Nintendo patch. The little things that make you laugh because you realize you‚Äôre so far gone, so deep in this team, that even font size matters. Goldy‚Äôs call of ‚Äúbeating the evil empire‚Äù will live in my head forever. Dom Canzone walking off the White Sox in extras, as I listened in the car on the way home from my last softball game of the season. These weren‚Äôt just games. They were stitched right into the fabric of my own life. Ichiro entered Cooperstown and the rafters this summer. A childhood hero enshrined forever. It was my wife turning 29, her ‚Äúbig dumper year,‚Äù and leaning into it with the same joy I found in baseball. When she went to bed, one of our puppies, Lizzy or Winnie curled up beside me like they knew I needed company to make it through another late-night West Coast finish. I made my return to the diamond as well. Slowpitch, sure. But it was something real: dirt under my cleats, a glove on my hand, sweat on my back. Sunflower seeds and bubblegum. A busted lip with the stitches to prove it, a reminder the game doesn‚Äôt let you play it halfway. I bought new gear. I felt the itch again. I felt a part of me come alive that I hadn‚Äôt felt since I was a teenager. And then came the clinches. Back-to-back nights that rewrote Mariners history. Clinching the playoff spot, and then, for the first time since 2001, clinching the AL West. I stayed up past 1 for both, grinning through stitches, exhausted but wide awake. My wife beside me, Lizzy and Winnie curled up nearby, all of us riding the wave together. Those nights weren‚Äôt just celebrations. They were catharsis. A release nearly a quarter of a century in the making. And Dad, the pact we made when I was a kid still stands: if the Mariners ever make the World Series, we‚Äôre going. Thirty-some years of waiting. Thirty-some years of ‚ÄúThis might be the year.‚Äù And now I can‚Äôt help but ask myself: will this actually be the year? That‚Äôs why Game 162 always hurts. Even in a year like this one, when there‚Äôs more baseball left, it still feels like saying goodbye. Because the daily heartbeat, the comfort of knowing there will always be a game tomorrow, is gone. The early spring nights when the world was still thawing out, when baseball returned like a promise, they‚Äôre already fading into memory. The random weekday games in Kansas City, the one-AirPod afternoons at work, the 9:40 first pitch on a quiet May night, they‚Äôre all ghosts now. And yet, I wouldn‚Äôt trade a second of it. Every inning, every high, every heartbreak. Because baseball is more than wins and losses. It‚Äôs family. It‚Äôs ritual. It‚Äôs a mirror. It‚Äôs a story you tell with the people you love. 162 games. I‚Äôll miss it all. But October awaits. And if this is the year the pact comes due, if this is the year the Mariners finally make it to the World Series, I‚Äôll be there. With my dad. With my wife. With the kid in me who never stopped believing.",https://reddit.com/r/Mariners/comments/1nt1054/i_watched_all_162_games_this_season_and_heres/,2025-09-28T22:01:43+00:00,PIT,4215

reddit_comment,Mariners,Ok-Confusion2415,"this is beautiful I had to temporarily relocate to the east coast due to elder care needs (which are going well) but I had to dump four games that I had tix for. Looks like I bought 21 games and made 15, including Weds vs COL where we took the title. Came back specifically for this week. I would have liked to see 61, 62, 63 but I guess I‚Äôll have to console myself with 59 and 60. What a season. I‚Äôm back east, won‚Äôt be here for postseason, but, yeah, you should go. I wasn‚Äôt going to go Wednesday and I had a long talk with myself that clarified a few things: 1. The whole reason you are back home for a week is baseball 2. if they clinch on Weds and I am not there I will literally regret it for the rest of my life So‚Ä¶ as much as it pains me to encourage the ridiculous postseason ticket prices, will you regret it forever if you don‚Äôt go?

reddit_comment,Mariners,djdeckard,"A man after my own heart. I was there at the Kingdome from the time I met and got autographs from such Mariner luminaries as Bruce Bochte, Dan Meyer, Julio Cruz. I was at the game Edgar went ballistic on the Yankees in the playoffs. For the magic 2001 season. I loved to San Framcisco in 2005 and thanks to T-Mobile I am able to watch every Mariners game on MLB.TV. I had the good fortune of being in Seattle the week of Ichiro‚Äôs uniform retirement. I was able to share the joy of the Mariners and what he meant to the city with my partner who has next to know sports knowledge. I learned to enjoy every minute of years like this. Be present and enjoy it because you never know when a season like this will happen again. Thank you for sharing.

So when it‚Äôs time for Randy to throw it to someone I am able to lock eyes with Randy as I‚Äôm pointing down to the kid infront of me. He nods and tosses it right to me.

Then the person in front of us caught a sky hot dog and she was sad she didn‚Äôt catch it so he gave her the hot dog. Right after that Randy hit the big home run to tie it, but we had to call it a night. On the way out she spotted the foam finger again at the merch stand, I said she couldn‚Äôt have it, and then the staff member offered it to her for free.

reddit_comment,Mariners,Maugrin,"Geno is a high strikeout hitter who walks below league average and hits an extreme number of pulled fly balls. What that means is that while he's well suited to hit lots of home runs, he doesn't have a lot of other ways to produce offense when he's not. That's why he's streaky. Nothing's wrong, the home runs have just slowed down for the last couple months (though he heated up a bit in the second half of September). Player production isn't a one-to-one reflection of how well they are playing. They can't control their production that minutely. You just hope that he heats up again. If he does, he can carry an offense.",https://reddit.com/r/Mariners/comments/1nv9qiu/whats_been_wrong_with_geno_and_will_he_be_his_old/nh7beel/,2025-10-01T15:40:11+00:00,ARI,623

reddit_comment,Mariners,monkeyboychuck,"Geno is literally hit or miss. Mostly he misses.

reddit_comment,Mariners,liquilife,Nothing is wrong with Geno. He hit 49 home runs this year. This man is not built to generally get on base. He‚Äôs built to hit home runs in high pressure situations.

I checked 10 hours after I bought my tickets just to see if there were still some available, and there were. But the time you used your code for 1 hour early access, the tickets were effectively long gone. $500 flex pack is a low price to pay, especially since I used the $500 for the Rockies series and sold them all to my friends at face value.

In no universe is that better. The reality is millions of people were going after those tix, and bots, but the available tix was going to be small either way. By the time it gets to presale a majority of the tix are already gone. Thats the reality of all events these days. I understand the frustration, but the idea of only in person buying overlooks all the issues associated with it. In the end scalpers find a way. They would just pay people to stand in line and buy up tix like they used to. Buying in person does nothing to stop reselling. Should they go back to paper tix too?

Watched Cal break the drought in 2022. Went to a Braves game in 2023 just because the Ms were playing. Watched Geno knock a homer to left that game. When we won the division this year, and I saw the first two ALDS games were on a weekend, I decided this year was the year. I've never been to T-Mobile Park. Never seen my team in their own home.

reddit_post,Mariners,Agreeable_Quality768,"This rebuild wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without Robinson Cano Way back in 2018, the Mariners were saddled with Robinson Cano‚Äôs 10 year, $240 million contract he signed back in 2014. There was a lot of salary on the table that would‚Äôve hamstrung a potential rebuild. All that aside, we gotta give credit to Dipoto for finding a way to dump Cano‚Äôs contract to set the rebuild in motion, because otherwise a rebuild would‚Äôve been much harder to accomplish. Keep in mind this was the last year with Cruz/Cano/Seager manning the middle of the lineup and it was a tough decision for Dipoto to decide to tear it all down but it‚Äôs worked in spades. Also Justin Dunn, one of the pieces in the deal, was eventually flipped for Eugenio Suarez and Jesse Winker, two factors that wouldn‚Äôt have made the 2022 playoff run possible and we might not have ever seen Geno in a Mariners uniform without this trade being done, and the fight that Winker started arguably started the playoff run.

reddit_comment,Mariners,mariner_mayhem,"None of this post makes any damn sense to me * Owners / Dipoto really should have embraced a tear down / rebuild as soon as Jack Z was shown the door. Delaying this did nothing for the franchise during the 2016-2018 seasons (no playoffs, and honestly Houston was a frickin powerhouse winning over 100 games in 2017 / 2018. * A player like Cano had way more trade value earlier in those years than later. * When we did offload Cano, it was largely a salary dump for a team that is not even close to being salary constrained, and we had to bundle the salary dump with a great young closer (Diaz) to get anything in return. * What we got in return for Cano also amounted to just about beans, because Kelenic did fuck-all in his career and was the biggest return piece. * Why even bring up Winker? He did nothing for us except play awful defense. His bat was mediocre here too. * And Suarez? Great pickup, that they then decided to salary dump to AZ and had to trade to get him back as a rental for this year's playoff run. The smarter move would be to just ... uh ... pay his salary and keep your prospects. > If you‚Äôre looking at a moment that the franchise changed, this would be it. No, it really wouldn't. I'd go so far as to say, offloading the Cano contract barely moved the needle on the direction of this franchise, except it delaying the rebuild with years of more mediocrity. What actually has changed the course of this franchise since then? Julio, Logan, Cal, Kirby, Woo, Miller (all drafts or international signings).

Most of them were absolutely ridiculous in the NY series. Edgar hit well over .500. In a 5 game series the '25 team would destroy every pitcher other than Johnson I think.

reddit_comment,Mariners,Highest-Adjudicator,"For me personally, it‚Äôs clear to see that the value a good catcher brings is leaps and bounds higher than any other position on the field. Even good teams in big markets will allow a starting catcher to be terrible with the bat as long as they are good at everything else. Just look at the Astros with Martin Maldonado. They won a World Series with him as their starting catcher putting up an OPS of .600. And usually catchers play their 100-120 games behind the dish and sit the other 40 games. But Cal plays those 40 days at DH, and since he is a good batter, he provides a lot of extra value you wouldn‚Äôt normally get out of a catcher. Just think about it‚Äîyou‚Äôre an average team with a great catcher who is the best hitter on the team‚Äîbut he needs his regular days off so he‚Äôs fresh enough to keep up his performance. So you would have a backup catcher playing in the place of your starter 40 games per season. Backup catchers usually can‚Äôt hit, so you‚Äôre basically taking a good bat out of the lineup and replacing it with a bad one. Now imagine you‚Äôre an average team with Cal Raleigh. When you put in the backup catcher, you‚Äôre adding a bad bat to the lineup, but you also get to keep your best bat in the lineup. That adds a lot of value that other catchers wouldn‚Äôt. Then you look at how many players have had a wRC+ of 150 or higher at the catcher position (min. 500 PA‚Äôs) in the last decade. The entire list is Cal Raleigh. Now, Fangraphs only shows stats by position, so that doesn‚Äôt include any stats from DH days. But that‚Äôs still super important to know when determining the value a catcher brings. The top end for a catcher is generally in the 130‚Äôs for wRC+, and Cal got to 174 as a catcher, 161 overall. In fact, no player has ever reached 160 wRC+ as a catcher over 500 PA‚Äôs as far back as Fangraphs data goes (I think 2002?) Except Cal Raleigh. When you take into consideration the value that teams place on good defensive catchers, how rare it is for a catcher to put up these kinds of numbers over the sample size of a full season, and the extra value added by playing every day, I think you can reasonably say that Cal provides a bit more value than Judge, even if you can‚Äôt measure it all exactly.",https://reddit.com/r/Mariners/comments/1nuivi0/judge_vs_raleigh_a_mostly_unbiased_breakdown_of/nh22c2t/,2025-09-30T19:05:28+00:00,Mariners,2220

This means that I am expecting 3-4 WAR seasons and 2 starter production which he didn‚Äôt provide.,https://reddit.com/r/Mariners/comments/1nuau0p/grading_the_2025_mariners_until_the_playoffs/ngzt24v/,2025-09-30T12:14:50+00:00,Mariners,294

reddit_comment,Mariners,Roscooooojenkinsssss,"Before the playoffs begin, I wanted to say thank you to the Mariners and all of you great Mariners fans. I grew up a Rockies fan, despite living in Houston, thanks to the influence of my grandfather. The last decade plus of being a Rockies fan had been particularly painful. Even making the playoffs, I could never forgive the ownership and management. The Tulowitzki trade, the Arenado trade, Bryant... So many things that made it hard to cheer for them and to even watch baseball. When my grandfather passed in February, I resolved that I wanted to go back to enjoying baseball and I wasn't going to let the Rockies drag me down. So I chose a new team and settled on the Mariners for three big reasons: I travel to Seattle a bunch for work and can actually go to games, I heard good things about this so-called Big Dumper and as a former catcher I have a soft spot for good catchers, and finally, it lets me continue to cheer against the Astros. Don't think I could have chosen a better or more fun team to cheer for this year. I've watched more baseball than I have in many many years and am so excited for the playoffs. So once again, thank you Mariners for a great year, and all of you here for the Good Vibes, and now, might as well win the whole fucking thing!!",https://reddit.com/r/Mariners/comments/1nu6ct0/daily_mariners_monologue_september_30_2025/nh0ynmn/,2025-09-30T15:54:41+00:00,Mariners,1268

reddit_comment,Mariners,stickymeowmeow,"Mariners playoff games will only be on Fox/FS1. So you don‚Äôt need to worry about TBS and ESPN. https://www.mlb.com/postseason/schedule If you live in the area (40-50 mile radius), buy an amplified TV antenna (under or around $50). It plugs into your TV directly. You‚Äôll be able to watch FOX (plus ABC, NBC, CBS and more) for free. FOX specifically has several transmitters on the fringe of Seattle OTA range to extend FOX into further suburbs. The question will be the split between FOX and FS1, because all the link above says is ‚ÄúFOX/FS1.‚Äù Whether that means it‚Äôs TBD which one it‚Äôll be on game-by-game or whether it means they‚Äôll be simulcast on both networks‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure.

W17-L2 with an 11 game streak at T-mobile is incredible by any measure and it saved our season to put us in the drivers seat for the playoffs.

reddit_post,OaklandAthletics,SactownG,"As a Giants fan in Sac, I find it cringe to see people get so hype about the ""Sacramento"" jerseys I would share this in the Sacramento A's sub, but as you probably expected I was banned over there simply for stating that the move to Sac is temporary, so I felt this was the best place to express my opinion. I feel like most the people who are excited about the new jerseys aren't even A's fans (most of which are probably Giants fans), they're just happy to have anything related to Sacramento being promoted at the national stage. It comes off as a cheap ploy to make a few more bucks in merchandise sales rather than a genuine attempt to embrace the city. To me I just can't feel connection and support for a team that is only here because they're being allowed to stay rent-free and is ran by one of the greediest owners in sports who took them away from a very loyal and dedicated fanbase. Not to mention the fact that they're not even going to stay here in the first place, even if the Vegas deal falls through there's more viable long-term options than Sacramento. Of course, I'm also a Giants fan but like I said it seems like the only people in Sacramento who've embraced the team being there aren't even A's fans. Most the A's fans I do know are just pissed off that they're leaving for Vegas in the first place and have little to no interest in going to a game at SHP.

reddit_post,OaklandAthletics,Puzzleheaded_Elk996,"Why I, as an A‚Äôs fan, am switching to the Giants Listen, I‚Äôve been loyal to this team for a majority of my life. My mom and grandparents are fans of the A‚Äôs, having grown up in Oakland, while my uncle and aunt are more fans of the Giants. I am still loyal to the Raiders and always will be. I love the culture and vibes of the fans. And hey, if you are still a fan of the A‚Äôs after everything that‚Äôs happened, MASSIVE power to you and I have a lot of respect for still being able to stay loyal to the team despite everything. And you can feel free to call me a bandwagon fan lol. But I‚Äôm not switching because ‚Äúoh giants are better haha‚Äù. The reason in switching is cause I have and will always support teams in the Bay Area (except the niners cause fuck the niners). Unlike the raiders, where they‚Äôre the type of team where the location of it doesn‚Äôt really matter it‚Äôs more about the team itself, the A‚Äôs and their culture was always connected to Oakland. They were the little guys that could, from the Everyman city of Oakland. That‚Äôs something I always loved about the A‚Äôs and why I remained a fan for such a long time. But John Fisher‚Äôs ownership and the stupid relocation to Sac and Vegas has made the A‚Äôs lose that Bay Area tie to me. I can‚Äôt support the A‚Äôs anymore because of John Fisher‚Äôs beyond shitty decisions and god awful treatment of the team. I want to stay loyal to the bay, with my mom‚Äôs side of the family being from Oakland and having been a fan of the Warriors and Raiders for all my life. I love the Bay Area too much to switch to supporting the A‚Äôs in Vegas. To me, unlike the Raiders, the A‚Äôs in my mind are a team in Oakland and will ALWAYS be a team in Oakland. To remove that identity from it means removing a key reason as to why I fell in love with the team. So cause of this, and cause my uncle and aunt were already Giants fans even back then, I made the choice to just switch to the Giants. I will always support Bay Area teams and will always be committed to the Bay. In short, fuck John Fisher and respect to all A‚Äôs fans who are still committed to this team despite everything. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to support this team anymore.",https://reddit.com/r/OaklandAthletics/comments/1ns83hx/why_i_as_an_as_fan_am_switching_to_the_giants/,2025-09-27T22:22:49+00:00,Giants,2169

They're both nepo-baby owners who abandoned Oakland for the sake of getting government handouts, and both refused to sell their teams despite crying broke.

reddit_post,OaklandAthletics,ernmanstinky,"A letter to my brother at a year post mortem. Thank you for putting up with my sappy thoughts. A letter to my brother at a year post mortem. Thank you for putting up with my sappy thoughts. ""It's been a year as of today. In some ways I feel a lot better and in some ways it's the same. The Oakland a's are dead. The coliseum will live out its days hosting small random events before its eventual demolition. It will be regulated to pur collective memories. It was the last bastion of working class and blue collar engagement. It was the last dive bar. When I initially moved away as a teen I took my oakland with me. The a's and the warriors were the easiest markers that were mutually understood to those around me. They were mostly associated with the kings and giants. It was an easy way to turn around the isolation I felt into a point of pride. ""Not only am I not one of you but I don't aspire to be."" When I moved to Canada I took both with me again. I became a vagabond, a diaspora if you will, and my marker of home was again the a's and warriors. Now, I have long stated that I never thought I'd feel that connection to a team again. It's fundamentally illogical. It's a bond that, I'd state, has to be formed when the magic of the tooth fairy and Santa Claus was viable. I've been happily proven wrong by the ballers. They've earned loyalty. They've shown their oakland identity is real and has meaning. While major league sports in general depends on that bond to foster connection and loyalty and, well, flow of money associated, they don't hesitate to throw it away when it suits them. I don't believe John fisher has had anything but a transactional relationship in his life. The culture of a's fandom meant nothing to him. We mean nothing to him. Given that he was born with set for life wealth adds more salt to the wound and scab to the scar associated with the death of the team. He was never rooted in Oakland but we are. He, and his 29-0 acquiescencent brethern will never get a dime from me again. I am proud to be connected to the legacy of oakland. In this case proud to have a commonality with last dive bar, the Oakland 68s, and oaklandish in their creation of the sell movement. While we did lose our team we championed a truthful narrative that became louder that the sactioned one; this was not and is not the fault of fans. Greed of those who have for more than their share is at root. They care nothing of what they hurt. We can be cast aside when convenient. But we aren't. We spun their narrative and remain. The success of the ballers serves as a vindication, joyous, and while it's indy ball it feels at least as significant as the 10 oakland championships prior. 72, 73, 74, 75, 77, 81, 89, 15, 17, 18. 25. In some ways more. One of the many ""jokes"" I've heard is ""the worst thing about San fransisco is that if you look across the bay you have to see oakland."" We are still a there there. We are still roses from concrete. While I must admit that if I happened to be stuck in an elevator with fjf nothing good (for him) would happen I do feel something good that I'd never thought I'd feel again. I have often thought that I am glad our deceased father didn't have to see this process. He lived in Oakland more than anywhere else in his life. I do find myself wishing I could talk to him about the recovery.

I like the Padres but not a fan of their UPS colorway So it‚Äôs Ballers first and then Dodgers for me Also, Im so used to attending like 20 Oakland A‚Äôs games every year. Went to 3 Giants games I believe this year as it‚Äôs very annoying getting to the stadium, could have gone to more but logistically it‚Äôs very inconvenient.

reddit_comment,OaklandAthletics,jml510,"Year 1 in the wilderness for me: * I've watched zero MLB games since attending the final Battle of the Bay. It's far easier for me to avoid the MLB than avoid the NFL; I always preferred watching football a little more (I don't have a particular NFL team I follow closely anymore, though), and Red Zone is fun to watch. * I miss watching and attending MLB games, but the relocation saga has left a sour aftertaste in my mouth. * I subscribed to Flo Baseball to watch the Ballers, and I checked out a few other teams like Missoula. I hope that the Ballers will get a TV deal soon; they deserve the additional exposure, and I don't want to keep paying for something that I pretty much won't use outside of their games. * I intended to go to a few Ballers games, but my job always got in the way--whether it's my work schedule or me being too exhausted to go after the work week. * I bought a custom-made Ballers safety vest for work. Someone had no idea who or what the Ballers are when commenting on my vest. Whenever I've talked with coworkers about the team, only one person regularly follows them and knew about their championship. * The schadenfreude from the A's rarely coming close to selling out a minor league park in their inaugural season there has been delicious. * I spent the past year hoping that JF would royally screw up his Vegas plans like he did for the Oakland, Fremont, and SJ plans, and that there'd be an Oakland miracle, but unfortunately, construction seems to be moving along in Vegas. * An increasing number of outsiders (non-Oaklanders) have realized that Oakland wasn't the problem all along. Oakland has received props in a few spaces for its diehard fans, unique fan culture, and how much money there is to be made here for a professional sports team, and there have been stories of some owners who considered opposing the relocation. I feel hopeful, though not optimistic, that Oakland could have the MLB return in one form or another once Manfred is gone.",https://reddit.com/r/OaklandAthletics/comments/1nr5qoi/how_has_your_year_in_the_wilderness_gone/ngd5wpl/,2025-09-26T20:05:51+00:00,Padres,1987

After I listened to Kotsay‚Äôs address to the fans (and had to pull over because I started crying profusely), I completely cut myself off. A‚Äôs baseball has meant so much to me.

reddit_post,angelsbaseball,Certain_Judgment6646,"Perry Minasian: A Retrospective Look (2025 Season Update) As a continuation of [this post looking at Perry through the years](https://old.reddit.com/r/angelsbaseball/comments/1kgbojd/perry_minasian_a_retrospective_look_into_his/) and my subsequent posts on this thread, here is my 2025 retrospective look: **2025 Season Update:** **Trades (a lack thereof):** Perry, as we entered the 2025 trade deadline 5 games back of .500/a WC3 slot, had a pretty big decision to make: What do we do with our plethora of players on expiring/1 year left deals (highlighted by Ward, Jansen, TA, Hendricks, Moncada, and Rengifo). While these may not be premium assets at the deadline, years past have shown teams are willing to trade prospects for assets like these, even if it‚Äôs low level (with us last year doing some good squeezes for Garcia and Estevez). As we saw though, Perry came out in front of the fanbase and said ‚ÄúWe are **obviously** very competitive‚Äù and held on to all of these assets to try and make ground on the WC3 slot. To contextualize his **obviously** comment: We had horrible run differential, our record was propped up by an unsustainable 1 run game record, and again ‚Äì we were 5 games back from .500 and the WC3 slot as the teams in front of us all bought at the deadline. But if we were so **obviously** competitive than, at minimal, we should‚Äôve had a competitive record to close out the season, right?! 19-34, an abysmal .358 record. Instead of acquiring ANY asset that can refresh our much farm (update on that later), Perry ‚Äúcooked‚Äù and we are in our 2nd 90 loss season in a row ‚Äì a feat last done in franchise history in 1968 and 1969 (during our first 10 years). **Our farm (a lack therof): ** As stated above, our farm was in a desperate need of refresh. As we entered the 2025 season we had a 30th ranked farm system uplifted by 2 top 100 prospects in Christian Moore (67 overall) and Caden Dana (77 Overall). There is a smidge of credit because Perry did go out and grab 14 international players to fill up the farm system ‚Äì but because they are so young and raw this is seen by most as extremely high risk but slimly possible high reward style building (as opposed to other teams who may use their international funds primarily on higher end prospects)/ Our farm system as we entered the season pre draft relied on a couple different details to hash out before we see where we fell: Christian Moore ‚Äì Will Perry learn his lesson and not call up his top pick ASAP to allow them to develop and not burn their playing time limit and lose prospect status? (more on this later) Ryan Johnson ‚Äì Will Perrys master plan of having RJ not play in the minors at all work out? Caden Dana ‚Äì Can he make the next step to solidify himself as a higher end arm on the prospect list? Aldegheri/Klassen ‚Äì Can they take the next steps like Dana to solidify themselves as top arm prospects? I will address Christian Moore later, but for our pitching prospects, they have seemed stuck in this AAAA type player funk. Dana ended his season starting 5 games (playing in 7) with a -0.4 WAR, 6.40 ERA, and a 6.48 FIP. Aldegheri started 2 games and appeared in 4 with a -0.5 WAR, 7.90 ERA and a 7.31 FIP. Klassen remained in the minors. Ryan Johnson had a lot of eyes on him due to Perry skipping the young arm from the minors to be on the opening day roster, he ended up playing in 14 games with a -0.7 WAR, 7.36 ERA, and a 5.52 FIP (earning him a trip all the way down to Single A). *And as a quick check in of the Perry Mastered All Pitchers 2021 Draft: * Sam Bachman appeared in 23 games of relief pitching only ‚Äì 20.1 innings. -0.2 WAR, 6.20 ERA, 3.63 FIP Chase Silseth appeared in 10 games, pitched relief only of 11.0 innings, 0.4 WAR, 1.64 ERA, and 3.86 FIP Crazy that the 2021 draft, 4 years later, provided our team with only 32 innings of pitching and 0.2 WAR of performance‚Ä¶ ***The 2025 MLB Draft *** As we approached the draft we had a lot of hope at the #2 pick. We had great draft positioning, we had some higher end college pitching talent, some high end High School prep talent, and all of our picks ready to refill our depleted farm. As the draft night started, the Nats shockingly took Eli Willits at #1, completely throwing the draft in disarray pretty quickly. The angels at #2 had some amazing choices to make: Do we go with Ethan Holliday the highly touted HS legacy talent to shore up our 3B hole? Do we go with Kade Anderson, the electric arm out of LSU a lot of scouts thought was the perfect Angels pick for Perrys quick call ups? Do we go with a Seth Hernandez and spend some actual developmental time building a pitcher? Do we go after a guy like Liam Doyle or Jamie Arnold as well known college dawgs? Manfred came up and announced what we are doing with the #2 pick of the MLB draft: Tyler Bremner. An absolute shock to all draft experts. While Bremner was highly touted pre college season, his stock dropped below some of the other pitchers due to his performance to start his season (even though he ended it well against lesser schools). There is of course the story behind Bremner and the absolute family tragedy that took place through the school year of his mother passing from cancer. And while his stock may have dropped because of his performance, he still was on a solid level to work with. But most people were confused of the idea to underslot the #2 pick (especially with Kade Anderson both going to your in division rival, known to produce elite pitching, who himself signed underslot). As the rest of the draft played out, Perry used the savings from underslotting that allowed him to acquire 8 new members of our internal top 30 prospects list. But as the dust settled the new farm rankings came out with: Angels overall 27th ranked farm 2 top 100 prospects: Christian Moore at 50 and Bremner at 96 (with Ryan Johnson just missing the cut) Again before we approach Christian Moore, while we picked Bremner at #2, he shook out as the 18th ranked prospect of the draft, falling behind Ethan Holliday, Kade Anderson, Seth Hernandez, Jamie Arnold, and Liam Doyle as players available and needed at the top spot. Of course time will tell for the young Bremner, and he may still have a successful MLB career ahead of him. But he will always be tied to this draft class as a ‚Äúwas it worth it at #2, was he better than everyone else‚Äù. It is a high risk gamble Perry took on the kid, and us Angel fans hope Perry is seeing something the experts aren‚Äôt. ***Christian Moore: *** Time to get to Christian Moore, our top prospect since drafting him in last years class. From day one the question wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow long will his development take‚Äù but ‚Äúwhen will Perry call him up in 2025? Will he burn his eligibility and prospect status in year one?‚Äù Let‚Äôs start with his holistic performance on the year. He started off in the Minors with some injuries, but shot through the system (as expected): In single A: a 1.534 OPS in 4 games In AA: .665 OPS in 34 games In AAA: .853 OPS in 30 games (some time between MLB and AAA happened this season too) Very quickly Moore was shot up through the system and on 6/13 he made his MLB debut. In 53 games his line was: .198/.284/.655 with 7 HRs, a 34% K rate, and an overall WAR of 0.1 (0.4 oWAR and -0.3 dWAR). Putting his full year ~600 AB projected stats at 0.3 WAR. Not the best showing but a great cup of coffee for our prospect. But‚Ä¶Christan Moore isn‚Äôt a prospect anymore‚Ä¶ ***Perry‚Äôs Asleep at the Wheel *** For a prospect to hold onto prospect status/not start their service time contract (basically as a team, you get 5 years of letting a prospect develop. If within those 5 years they spend 45 days on a MLB roster in the season, then their contract gets converted to a 5 year MLB contract until they hit FA. The gist is it gives incentive for the Org to develop a prospect and call them up when they are ready instead of rushing guys up quickly). So why do I bring this up? On 9/1 Perry decided, after sparse playing time for Moore, to send him down to AAA to get ever day playing time (because we really needed to give ABs to guys like Moncada and Rengifo who we kept on because we were **obviously** competitive). That sounded like a great idea, the rookie prospect isn‚Äôt getting every day ABs so send him down, let him finish the season in AAA and try again next year! But wait‚Ä¶on 8/31, the day prior, Christian Moore completed his 45th day on an MLB roster, converting his draft contract into a service time contract, thus not only losing his status as a prospect but starting his MLB contract. So Perry fell asleep at the wheel of our Org and burned the developmental time we could‚Äôve had with Moore. Just an absolute HILARIOUSLY BAD management that is the epitome of Perry‚Äôs Tenure here and his overall approach to our farm. **Free Agency Work (a step in the right direction) ** Perry, through his FA work pre season and waiver wire work mid season, acquired 2.5 WAR in total at a cost of $46.8M (I am going to round this down to $40M due to guys being cut). So in total perry spent $16M per 1 WAR, still way below the average of $8M but much better than his $30ishM he usually spends. If we strictly restrict it to offseason signings (off the top of my head its: D‚Äôarnaud, Newman, Tim Anderson, Kingery, Kikuchi, Hendricks, and Jansen), he put in a respectable 5.7 WAR of production on $44.8M of contracts, or less that $8M per WAR! HE‚ÄôS AVERAGE!!!!!! Overall that puts his overall FA spend at $272M (will round down to $250M for any contract mistakes) and a TOTAL of 7.8 WAR over the last 5 years, or about $35M per WAR of FAs and Waiver wire pick ups. Again, some downright terrible spending but he was able to be effective in the offseason, which is a step in the right direction. Johnny Washington (Suspect of Victim?) Public enemy #1 this offseason from the fanbase was Johnny Washington, and at an outsiders glace it seems that all batting issues are on him! But lets quickly go through the history of our batting pre and post Perry, starting in 2018: Stats laid out as AVG, OBP, OBP Rank, Slug, Slug Rank, OPS, OPS Rank, K%, K% Rank (higher rank is better for k% rankings) 2018: .242 / .313 / 20th / .413 / 12th / .726 / 16th / 21.3% / 8th 2019: .247 / .304 / 14th / .422 / 20th / .746 / 18th / 20.4% / 3rd 2020: .248 / .332 / 9th / .430 / 12th / .763 / 12th / 21.2% / 5th **2021: .245 / .310 / 21st / .407 / 17th / .717 / 19th / 23.2% / 16th ** 2022: .233 / .297 / 26th / .390 / 17th / .687 / 23rd / 25.7% / 30th 2023: .245 / .317 / 18th / .426 / 8th / .743 / 12th / 24.8% / 26th 2024: .229 / .301 / 27th / .369 / 28th / .671 / 28th / 23.7% / 19th 2025: .225 / .298 / 28th / .397 / 17th / .695 / 23rd / 27.1% / 30th As we can see when Perry started the 2021 season, our K%s shot straight up. As a team, pre Perry we hovered around a 21% K rate and usually was a top 10 team. The moment we took over we are averaging a 25% K rate. Now, Johnny Washington‚Äôs approach is bad for a team like ours (and honestly bad holistically, he likes to trade OBP and patience for HRs), but his philosophy closely aligns with Perry‚Äôs which is high K rates are not an issue. And how do we know this? When Nevin was our manager 2 years ago, he was asked about that high percentage (25% on the season). His answer was: The org sees that as a productive at bat and that the theories state that high strike outs are good. Nevin, the hot headed buffoon of a manager, is talking batting theories? Or more likely, parroting what the front office is telling him. So yes‚Ä¶fire JWash, just know that this is an organizational philosophy issue at it‚Äôs core from Perry, and not a specific batting coach (unless the 3 batting coaches under Perry‚Äôs watch somehow all brought higher strike out rates and not either Perry‚Äôs approach or roster building). **The Young Core Performance ** Of course one of the main components of someone who defends all the above bad farm rankings and overall team rankings would be: THE YOUNG CORE IS ELITE AND SETS US UP FOR YEARS OF SUCCESS THANKS TO PERRY. But the fact of the matter is, overall, our young core at the MLB level and our farm rankings do not show the excitement that the fan base is trying to have over these guys. Let me start with: Neto is a stud. Dude just needs to not be injured for parts of the year but overall Perry did good on this draft pick. There is nothing in his game that screams streaky or unsustainable, and the fact that he came from a shoulder surgery and still crushed it speaks volumes because he is only growing from this point. Now lets overall look at some rankings. If we go on fangraphs, and isolate down to the 2025 season on players age 14-26 (cutting off at Adell because I don‚Äôt believe Rengifo is part of the ‚Äúyoung core‚Äù). Our batters that would contribute to this ‚Äúyoung core‚Äù rank: 25th at 4.4 total fWAR on the season (Neto compromises 3.2 of that fWAR). As a comparison, Nick Kurtz alone is 4.6 fWAR Pitching is: 24th ranked at 1.8 fWAR (pretty much held by Soriano at 3.0 fWAR and Detmers at 1.2 fWAR ‚Äì 2 non Perry pitchers) Overall, our Young Core still has ample time to develop of course, but there are red flags. O‚ÄôHoppe continuing his regression from the all star break last year is horrible to see and something you don‚Äôt expect from a guy who was drafted in 2018, had years to develop, and started off great. He is entering his prime seasons and really needs to turn it around. Schanuel still shows an elite eye and approach at the plate, but his serious lack of power is unbefitting of the position he plays in. Not that the guy needs to launch 40-50 HRs but he needs to hit it in the power alleys and start hitting some doubles at the least. Like Nolan is some power away from being a Freddie Freeman like player (seriouslty look at 2024 Freddie Freeman‚Äôs savant vs current Schanuel, the difference between them is straight hitting the ball at better angles in the gap) who also is in the mid 20 HRs. Saying Nolan needs power isn‚Äôt saying he needs to be Bryce Harper. Christian Moore was outlined above ‚Äì Perry fell asleep at the wheel and now he NEEDs to start producing at the MLB level instantly. Time will also tell Adell has proven to be a valuable at bat but terrible in CF. The issue is, again, Perry‚Äôs horrible roster management. With us keeping Ward, Trading for Soler, there already is a logjam in the corner OFs. And with both Nolan and Logan maybe needing a position change to better suit them, that just adds more questions to the mix. Add to all of this: a 27th ranked farm that has no answers for our lack of offensive depth, this young core needs to grow exponentially or else everything crumbles. **Side Notes ** The Soler trade adds too much salary for a below average aging batter, especially one that sucks in the corner OF that we are log jammed in and takes DH spots away from Trout. While Canning messed up his ACL on a freak injury, losing him was a big loss to a rotation that was begging for a starter. Speaking of giving up pitchers, Patrick Sandoval will be in the mix for Boston next season. It will be interesting to see how he develops post injury and if the Angels gave up on him too soon. Overall exiting my criticism of Perry and thinking holistically, we are in a HUGE bind as a franchise. Our MLB roster is lackluster and losing a lot of players the next 2 seasons WHILE ALSO needing to up pay for the Young Core. Our GM is on a short extension so whatever plan he has needs to be executed immediately and be successful or we are in a deep hole as his contract expires. Our manager probably should retire for his own health, which means YET ANOTHER voice leading these young guys. Like seriously Neto is just hitting arb years and might be working under his 4th manager LOL I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll add more to this as I mull over the season.

By my calculation, their MLB signings (d‚ÄôArnaud, Hendricks, Kikuchi, Jansen, Newman, Moncada) combined for 4.6 fWAR or 6.9 bWAR. As you said, that puts him slightly above-average according to bWAR, and slightly below-average according to fWAR. Solid. The reoccurring issue is depth adds. Anderson wound up being a solid minor league signing. Kingery was acquired in a trade and cleared waivers before OD, so nothing wrong with that. Perry needs to be more proactive on the waiver market, especially in the bullpen. I‚Äôm going to lump the draft and farm system into one. IMO you‚Äôre taking an overly pessimistic stance on Moore. Is anyone complaining that Caglianone was ‚Äúrushed‚Äù to the majors? As I‚Äôve said before, teams are advancing their players through the minors faster than ever. This is not something that is exclusive to Perry or the Angels. Also, Moore‚Äôs 45 days ran out on 8/27 and would have expired after they recalled him in September, anyways. ‚ÄúProspect status‚Äù is only relevant if you believe he has a legitimate shot at winning ROY or MVP next season (I don‚Äôt). He looked good in the last two weeks and I think it helped his confidence. I still think we‚Äôre overreacting about the draft. Seattle was planning on taking Bremner at 3OA. Nobody is arguing that Bremner is clearly superior to Anderson, but the gap isn‚Äôt huge and Bremner signed for over $1mm less. Again, none of these guys have played an inning of pro ball yet so it‚Äôs far too early to cast judgement. Some other points: * I agree that putting Johnson on the OD roster was dumb. * ‚ÄúStrikeouts‚Äù have become the baseball equivalent of a trigger word. The 2023 Twins have the record for most strikeouts in a single season‚Äîthey also won 87 games and their division title. * I don‚Äôt believe O‚ÄôHoppe will need to change positions. ABS will lessen the impact of framing and he has a respectable CS% this season. * Canning is now a FA and, ironically, Hendricks ended up providing more value for half of what Canning would have cost in Arb. * Regardless of what Sandoval does in Boston, it was time for both sides to move on. I‚Äôve always been a fan and hope he does well next season. Final thoughts: I think the direction of the organization changed significantly post-Ohtani and I believe that Perry has done his best work in that time. Since the end of the ‚Äô23 season, they have signed zero FA‚Äôs with QO‚Äôs attached, traded zero top 30 prospects, and have added some decent prospects through trades (Klassen, Aldegheri, Lugo, Farris, etc). I‚Äôm not saying the guy is a genius, but he has done nothing to negatively impact the long-term outlook of the team since Ohtani left.",https://reddit.com/r/angelsbaseball/comments/1nts63h/perry_minasian_a_retrospective_look_2025_season/ngww354/,2025-09-29T23:00:31+00:00,Nats,3063

reddit_post,angelsbaseball,DavefromCA,"Yesterday was my sons first pro sports event My son took up baseball this summer and is shockingly good, so I wanted to get him to a pro game before the season ended. He‚Äôd never been to a professional sports venue before. I grew up in the Bay Area watching the Bash Brothers and Barry Bonds. I moved to Santa Barbara in 2010 to be with my then-girlfriend (now wife) and have been here ever since. Because he‚Äôs still young, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with brutal traffic, nor did I have the funds to spend several hundred dollars on great seats. I wanted him as close as possible to the action. What better choice than a Sunday noon Angels game? I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for the Angels, even when they beat the Giants in the World Series. My first memory of the Angels was seeing a one-armed pitcher in the mid-90s take it to San Francisco, and I loved watching Troy Percival, Tim Salmon, Jim Edmonds, and Garrett Anderson. We got to the stadium 90 minutes early and walked right in. Grabbed Angel Dogs, wandered the park, got a picture of the trophy then settled into our seats ‚Äî five rows behind the visitors dugout. I was shocked how close we were, you could really hear the ball pop in the catcher‚Äôs mitt and the crack of the bat. I explained to my son the game wasn‚Äôt playoff-relevant, but told him to watch closely how the pros play. Mike Trout, his favorite player, homered. His first pro sports game, and a Trout home run right in front of us, with fireworks and flamethrowers to cap it off. Even though the Angels lost, it couldn‚Äôt have been a better first experience.

reddit_post,angelsbaseball,cchoi712,"If healthy, I think Mike Trout can bounce back and be elite again Mike had huge down year in 2025. He's 33 year old veteran who has been suffering from injuries since 2021. I know I could be biased and delusional cuz I love him so much but I truly believe Trout can rebound from this bad season if he can stay healthy (Yes I know this already is a big question) Basically, Mike had 2 abysmal stretches in 2025. One was from the season opener to the end of April before he injured his knee again, and the other was in mid-August where he went 7 for 47 with 0 HR, batting .149 w/ .492 OPS. These 40 something games, where he batted like .170, pulled his season average down badly. Other than those 2 periods, Mike was pretty much slashing .260/.380/.500 with high-.800 OPS in 90 games, which is not really Mike Trout-ish but still very good. According to Baseball Savant, Mike has superb batting values except for 4 stats. xBA (bottom 25%), Squared-Up% (bottom 6%), Whiff% (bottom 16%), K% (bottom 2%). Other than these, he has everything between 70\~100% percentile. His barrel%, LA sweet-spot%, hard-hit% are not much off from his usual self. He still generates tons of power. Also, even with his bad K rate, his chase rate is great and he is walking a lot. Pair that with the fact that he is 100% in sweet-spot% and 93% in barrel%, I think he is seeing the ball well. His plate discipline is there, he's putting the baseball on the barrel, he hits w/ sweet spot, and he's not chasing out of the zone. Then I think his bad xBA and high whiff% that leads to a lot of strikeouts is because his timing is off. I'm no expert but if I remember correctly, Mike was striking out a lot in his slumps because he was late on FBs or he was watching off-speed pitches in the zone. (including his normal behavior of watching the first pitches lol) His zSwing% is the lowest since 2015. It suggests that he really let a lot of pitches go in the zone. I don't know where to find stats for swinging late on Fastballs or swinging off-timing but that's what I remember seeing from Mike a lot this season. I think most would agree throughout his career, when Trout struggles, it was mostly due to him not catching up to the FB. It was the case in 2014, which KC took advantage of in ALDS, it was the case in 2020 in Pandemic-shortened season when he had ""relatively"" down year, it was the case in 2024 too. This year, Mike actually has the best statistics vs FB. Even better than vs Breaking pitches. However, his stats vs Off-speed pitches are awful. He slashed .184/.241/.265 vs Off-speed pitches. So here is what I think might have happened to Mike this season. Pitchers know Mike's weakness is 95+mph FB so they threw a lot of FBs to Mike (66.1% of pitches to Trout was FB variations) Therefore Mike set his timing on FBs to deal with it, messing up with his timing vs slower pitches. He is still seeing the ball well, but not timing his swings right. I think his bad left knee could have affect it too. He wanted to play RF at the beginning of season, hurt his knee again, and when coming back, he wanted to play RF again but he said he still felt pain when playing defense reps so he played full time DH afterwards, means his knee was not fully healed. Also, immediately after hitting his 400th HR, Mike said in the interview that he's happy he got it out of the way this year, suggesting that his mid-August slump could have been affected by him feeling pressured for #400. Next season, Trout will have #400 in the books. He will have full off season to take care of his knee. He didn't play a lot of baseball between 20\~24 but for the first time since 2019, he played 130 games and saw a lot of live pitches. I believe (and of course I hope) Mike will bounce back as far as he stays healthy. He might not be a 10-WAR guy and perenial MVP candidate again, but I think he still has multiple elite seasons in him.

I will start by saying my vote for team MVP will go to Zach Neto. Jose Soriano is someone who I view is certainly rising in the organization. I think most people would agree Logan O‚ÄôHoppe is falling fast, but id love to hear someone elses name. Jo adell is certainly someone who excites me in the organization. I do hope the halos consider bringing Chafin back, I also wouldnt be opposed to Jansen or Moncada returning.

I got to love and enjoy baseball games without the external worries of wasting Trout‚Äôs career or failing to hold on to Ohtani.

Soriano had classic young pitcher struggles but I‚Äôm optimistic about him going forward.
